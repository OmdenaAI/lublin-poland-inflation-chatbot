## Problem statement

Inflation and high living costs have become a problem for the inhabitants of Poland. This problem is especially visible in the poorer parts of the country, such as the Lubelskie Voivodeship, with the city of Lublin, its capital. Current inflation rates indicate its level at 18%, which is the highest rate in 26 years in Poland. Such a high level of inflation causes the reduction of jobs in companies, or even the closure of entire enterprises. Many people have lost their jobs, which until recently was a very rare situation due to the low unemployment rate. This is a new situation for the inhabitants of Lublin, with which not everyone is coping with equally well. Consequently, these people need both financial and mental support.

## Project goal

The goal of this project is to create a virtual chatbot that extracts the expression of mental health states through dialogue-based human-computer interaction to support people who cannot cope in these difficult economic times. The resulting chatbot will also be able to answer any user's questions about the possibility of saving money or depositing it safely.

##	Data pre-processing

From the insights of the EDA, we selected different data sources (Myfico, Bogglehead and Quora forums). We completed Data Cleaning with feature selection, drop null rows, drop rows outside of context, and outliers’ question and answer length. All these data sources have been merged into one file. To this file, one copy has been made and then has been applied all the steps for NLP pre-processing. We removed all the punctuation, links, emojis, numbers, and stop words. Then applied tokenization and lemmatization using the module nltk. We kept the original file with all the data merged. We analysed what would be the best approach for different models with processed and unprocessed data.
