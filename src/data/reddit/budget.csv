Excel for 4 banks and multiple accounts?,3,zvlimd,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/zvlimd/excel_for_4_banks_and_multiple_accounts/,1,"Tl;dr at the end!
So we currently have an excel sheet that my wife and I put together but it's a little hard to look at. Maybe one of you wizards has a similar or better set up. 

We currently use WF CC for most transactions as we get the cash back and have a tab for money spent and marking when the payment reflects on the account details online (sometimes they take a couple of days) as well as a payment made to the balance owed (usually weekly)

Another tab is reserved for the main account that gets my direct deposit. Since its the main account, it has options for categorizing the money spent and whether it was already paid to WF. This data automatically updates to the WF tab. We also keep track of a savings account here with money for car insurance for 6 months, vet bills, termite bond, and HOA stuff; savings we make to pay these off in one go.

There are 2 more tabs for 2 more banks with their respective savings and checking accounts that are rarely used, but when they are, the NFCU account will flag and pull values into these tabs as well. 

I want to see if any of you have built a similar spreadsheet that can allow us to input on one single tab and pull the info into all other tabs as needed with drop down selections or whatever. 

TL;DR: I have 4 banks including my WF CC and various checking and savings accounts that I want to keep track of on excel the easiest way possible i.e. input info once and have dates, amounts, categories and savings reflect on their respective tabs. Thanks in advance!",1672055000.0

I make my mortgage payments, bills and other monthly expenses in full too but then any leftover just gets spent and honestly I don’t know where.

How do I start again? How do I keep going and keep the motivation once I hit a goal? I think my issue was that once I reached my goal I back-pedalled and lost the discipline I had.

Looking for “pocket” style budgeting service,3,zrs2ye,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/zrs2ye/looking_for_pocket_style_budgeting_service/,9,"So, I’m currently banking with ONE Finance but I’m looking for a new banking solution due to the lack of transparency & the rate at which they’re removing features. I’m hoping I can just go to a traditional bank & use a budgeting tool on top of my account to help me manage my money. The problem is, I’m not sure which tool to use.

I have ADHD & I impulse spend like crazy but there are two things I love about ONE that really helped me save: I can split my money into different “pockets” so that I only see what I have budgeted to spend when I open the app (instead of all my money at once) + I can assign virtual cards to different pockets. This helps me make sure I only spend a certain amount of money on select services & once the money runs out, they can’t get to my main “pocket” with the rest of my money.

Is there any budgeting service that has these features? Or, is there a way to replicate these features with only a couple of apps? Also, I’ve tried some budgeting apps in the past but couldn’t stick with them because they took a long time to show my transactions so I ended up spending money I didn’t really have. So that’s also a factor for me.

Thank you so much for any help you can provide.",1671638510.0
Can I do this?,4,zrfvls,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/zrfvls/can_i_do_this/,11,"Recently accepted an offer for a job in a new city, starting at the end of January. It’s a sales position with a base salary as well. The rent in this area is rather high. Although I’m 26 this is my first time going to be living on my own and concerned how I’ll make the budget work with a sort of variable income

Salary is $77,500 paid bi weekly (after taxes I’m figuring it’ll be $2,385 every 2 weeks) 

Rent is $2080/month. Works out to be around 45% of my base salary alone.

Commissions - they are giving me a $9000 draw (guaranteed commissions) spread over the first 6 months and then I’ll have to work for commissions after that. The amount I can make each month with commissions varies greatly so don’t want to rely on that too much

Company also pays for the car, insurance, maintenance, and gas - so no extra expenses for the car

Additional fixed expenses:
-$20/month renters insurance
-apartment complex estimated me $150/month for utilities in summer months and $250/month in summer months
-Wifi: ~$80/month
-gym membership: $30/month
-student loans $180/month

Variable expenses:
-food: never lived completely alone before so not sure what to estimate for this 
-toiletries/cleaning supplies/ etc. : same as food I’ve never lived alone so not sure what to expect 

My main concern is after the commission draw runs out the first 6 months I’m worried my rent is too high for my base salary. Am I being paranoid or can I pull this off?

TLDR: is $2080/rent too high for a $77,500 base salary (before taxes)",1671616096.0

Rate My 2023 Budget,8,zqv2xk,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/zqv2xk/rate_my_2023_budget/,5,"Okay so I feel like I'm missing something in my budget. My primary financial goal this year is to significantly reduce my debt (its not physically possible for me to get rid of all of it but I'll get damn close. (For TLDR, look at the table at the bottom)

My take-home pay is a little over $27K per year and I get paid twice per month (\~1.1k per paycheck). I'm living with my parents still and they ask for $616 to cover my portion of the bills. My credit card debt as of making this post is about $1,800 and my car loan is $16.5k (I just bought the car this year). The credit cards will be paid of by early March 2023 if I allocate $400/paycheck towards paying them down. 

The minimum payment for the car loan is $377, and after my cards are paid off, I plan on paying at least $200 more (total $577/month). I also plan on putting 75% of any income tax I receive towards paying this down ([This IRS Calculator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/tax-withholding-estimator/about-you/) estimates I'll get $2.7k, so about $2k of this will go towards the car). If I get any bonuses from work, I'll allocate at least 50% of that as well. With that, my car loan should be paid off within 2.5 years (its a 72 month loan, I'm trying to pay it off early to save on interest). In addition to paying down the car loan, I want to increase my savings accounts which I plan on doing after the cards.

Creating a Budget with Partner: Fun Money / Priorities,12,zcpjni,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/zcpjni/creating_a_budget_with_partner_fun_money/,12,"I (30F) am married and have been budgeting with my partner (29M) for about 2 years (married for 2, together for 10). We are both pretty conservative with our money and align similarly. We reevaluate our budget bi-yearly together and typically agree on budgeting decisions. We do prioritize different things which can cause some conflict which I am sure is common. We set aside money for “Fun Money” each month and that includes all of our personal expenses; drink with friends, any shopping that is above our clothing budget, any other expenses that are “non-essential”. I guess I’m wondering what everyone considers “non-essential”. For example, I wear make-up and use more skin/ hair products than my husband. What do I consider essential and non-essential? If I run out of foundation and need to purchase another one- I consider that essential but if I just want a new lip product because I think I would enjoy it- I use my fun money. That makes sense to me but what about skin/ hair care products (within reason) that I consider essential but I’m partner feels is extra spending/ should come out of “fun money”? He doesn’t really run into this issue because he has a pretty basic routine. And of course I want to honor our goals and budget so I’m trying to compartmentalize this in a way that makes the most sense. What has worked for you and your partner? Just want to get different ideas/ perspective. Thank you!",1670196535.0

Health, dental, and vision are completely covered by my employer so I have no cost for that     
Employer provides all my food (breakfast, lunch, dinner, “pantry”) so my cost is very low for food. Usually just buy when I want something specific.     
I put 10% into a pre tax retirement and 10% into an after tax retirement, both employee sponsored with matching. Any bonuses I have 25% put into each of these accounts so I receive 50% of my bonus.

I also have my watch connect to cell service, that is owned by me completely. My bill in the past has been $120 per month. This is probably the bill I have the most resent towards because it seems extremely high.

Hi everyone, I’m a 22 female moving out for the first time and looking for some budgeting advice for paying rent. I am a full time fitness instructor, I teach 6 days a week, sometimes 7 to make extra money. My boyfriend and I are moving in together next month, he’s been living on his own for a few years but this will be my first time and i’m feeling very overwhelmed about bills. 

I’ve looked at my income, and I know I make enough to afford rent and other bills I have, but it will be very tight and I’ll have to watch my spending quite a bit. I’m fine with this since next year I will start making quite a bit more income. 

I’m not sure where to begin for budgeting. I downloaded the app RocketMoney but i’m not sure I love it. I don’t want to rely on using my credit card too much, so i’d like to make sure I can use my checking account when bills come around. I was thinking of making a second checking account, putting majority of my paycheck in that account for rent/bills and then the rest setting aside for more spending/fun things. But I don’t know if that’s a good idea?

I like the ability to connect to all of my banks and cc's, manually add transactions (done rarely), setup custom categories (I like the idea of transaction rules but don't use it a lot because its buggy on Mint), and set rough monthly spending limits.

...and that's about all I want from an app. Everything else is bloat for me since I perform my actual budgeting and planning on a spreadsheet using the monthly category totals on Mint as inputs, and I'd like to keep it that way.

I've tried using YNAB for almost an entire trial period and don't think I'm a good match for the product: YNAB focuses a lot on the budgeting portion of personal finance, to the point where it is shoved down the user's throat (spamming when you need to make allocations, viewing transactions for a category hidden behind multiple clicks, and broken/unintuitive credit card payment handling). It's funny -  I think the reason I don't like YNAB is because it's \*too\* good at budgeting, and I'm used to and have built a system around a budgeting-lite app.

So are there any apps you guys are using that support custom transaction management that doesn't focus too much on budgeting? I track 10 bank accounts and 10 cc accounts. iOS and web/desktop support are required


Edit: I'm going with Copilot. See my comment response below for more details, but it has everything I need and more.

One aspect of my budget I’ve been able to streamline is groceries. I started meal planning and found that the time invested was really worth the squeeze. I became increasingly passionate about it and digging in a bit more found that the average American wastes about $1,800 of food per year and spends about $3,000 on delivery, take-away, and dining out, and those are pre-inflation figures! If you cut those by two-thirds each that's $3,200 in savings. I'm located in a high cost of living area and cut food waste by near 100% and eating out by 75%, so personally my GF and I are saving nearly $10K / year together. It's mind boggling since it's not as if we were living in the lap of luxury or anything, near median incomes and lifestyles for our area.

As the journey progressed, and after trying several apps that didn’t quite seem to do the job, my friends and I decided to try to build an app that will help people streamline their grocery expenses by meal planning and making managing inventory easier.

Preparing for Black Friday & Cyber Monday,6,z2ulc2,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/z2ulc2/preparing_for_black_friday_cyber_monday/,1,"With the holiday shopping season coming up I’ve been thinking a lot about how to navigate the “big” shopping days from both a productivity and financial POV. Here are my thoughts so far, please add any other tips!

**What gifts can you actually save the most on?**

I’ve been reading a lot on what you can actually save on and what you should pass on for Black Friday/Cyber Monday/etc. What have you all read? Here’s what I found are the best things to focus on:

* Some electronics - laptops, kindles, headphones/airpods
* Small appliances and gadgets 
* Home goods
* TVs - not the cheapest of the cheap ones though! 

**How should you shop?**

* Start your gift search early
* Search for coupon codes - I’ve heard good things about Rakuten, Honey, etc.
* Shop online - brick and mortar Black Friday shopping still exists, but it seems to be easier to get what you want online. Also, it’s nice to be in your pjs.
* Use websites and apps - NerdWallet put out a good article on this [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/best-apps-black-friday-shopping](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/best-apps-black-friday-shopping)
* Don’t get trapped in \*\*all the excitement and hype\*\* - the world will not end if you don’t get exactly what you want
* Track price changes of the things you really want - I’ve heard good things about Camel Camel Camel or Keepa for Amazon tracking
* Remember it’s not just about Black Friday:
   * Small Business Saturday
   * Cyber Monday
   * Green Monday
* If you’re a member of any loyalty programs, don’t forget about special deals you may get there
* Follow social media hashtags like #blackfriday #smallbusinesssaturday #cybermonday - you’ll likely find many brands advertising good deals

**How do you keep your wallet from lighting on fire?**

* Create a list of everyone and everything you need to buy for THEN set a budget for each person and stick to it
* Track your spending using an app
* Don’t accrue credit card debt you won’t be able to pay off in full
* If you’re a savvy credit card user - game your purchases so you also maximize points/rewards
* Be aware of your thoughts and feelings while shopping. If you’re feeling impulsive - leave the store or walk away from your laptop. Take a breath. Take a break. Impulsivity is a killer of good personal finance habits.
* A little planning and forethought can save you a ton of money",1669223399.0

How do you guys budget gas?,4,z1tay5,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/z1tay5/how_do_you_guys_budget_gas/,12,"For anything else I swipe a card for I have a system. Subscriptions/non-rent bills are on a card and paid off biweekly from checking. Grocery and discretionary budget is deposited into a separate checking account biweekly. Extra stays there so I’m able to “save” for fun without messing up the rest of my budget. Half of my rent and loan payment stays in checking every 2 weeks+ a fixed buffer for unexpected bills. 

It doesn’t feel like gas money belongs in any of these categories. I don’t want it mixed in with my spending/grocery money because it’s so volatile. I don’t want to overspend just because gas was cheaper or I drove less. Right now I put it on my card and pay off from checking, but I don’t love that because if I wasn’t doing that I could chop the card up or keep it locked up for emergencies. I could treat it like a “bill” with half getting deposited to my bills checking, but it’s so volatile I worry about it eating at my buffer. I average about 16 miles/day. Maybe every 3 months I travel 500 miles round trip to visit family. 

Maybe a separate rewards card would be worth balancing a 4th account? I know it all comes out the same in the wash. My primary goal is making things as simple and routine as possible. The only number that EVER fluctuates in my budget is debt. My buffer is designed to stop unexpected necessities from digging me into more debt. Savings are the same, spending is the same, buffer is the same, any “extra” is put towards debt. I like divvying up my money this way because the goal is consistently moving forward and knowing exactly how much progress I’m making. Putting fluctuating gas spending on my bills credit card makes things messy. If it was practical I would literally escrow gas for the sake of simplicity.",1669122859.0

"Living w family, want to move out (late life re-start) need realistic budget (been saving almost all earnings for a year!)",4,z09sqm,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/z09sqm/living_w_family_want_to_move_out_late_life/,10,"I was on contract for over a year, and now I have full time employment (my first ever 9-5). I make good money, and have been saving (almost) all of my income. Living with family since my ex left. Divorce almost finalized, waiting on paperwork. Shared custody, two teenagers. 

Other than this past year, I have no savings, no equity, no retirement. Now that I have full time I will be funding 401k at max. After withholdings, my current net income is about $6k/mo. I have about $70k liquid in HYSAs earning ~3% APY and about $10k on a 0%ARP card (so 60k worth, just letting the cash grow in the HYSA while the debt accrues 0%. I otherwise never carry a balance and never pay interest.)

I am fundamentally opposed to paying rent ever again. I expect to purchase a house in the next 3-10 months. I am in my mid/later 30s and have paid so much in rent over the years that I could be a landlord by now if it had gone to equity...

Where I live, it's not very high cost of living, but it's mid-atlantic, so maybe average. I expect a house to cost me between 400-600k depending on the market over the next few months. First time home-buyer, no idea what to expect. I know this might be the wrong sub for this sentiment, but YOLO.

I'm vegetarian and do not chase fancy food, so rice/beans/bread/cheese/grains/cereal/noodles and some fresh greens is my basic diet. Car is 15y+ Honda hybrid that is in disrepair and gets under 20mpg, but I don't drive much (sticker exempt under 5,000mi/year) so gas is about $50-100/mo. Electricity where I live is under $0.08/kWh generation and same for distribution, so about $0.15/kWh total. I don't know what I'd use if I wasn't living with family. I work from home so there are computers that need power, etc. and I don't do great without climate control, so I do use AC in the summer and heat in the winter. I'm just being honest and self-aware.

Also, and this is big, I have some health issues including ""adult adhd"" (see: username) and one of the things I really need to work into my budget is a maid service. I was traveling for work for a while, grocery costs were down, and staying in hotel meant less cleaning chores. I know many on this sub will say ""buck up and clean your damn bathroom,"" and in principle, I agree. My plan is sub-optimal, but I want to plan for success and budget more conservatively and not assume that I can get by on a small budget and then go over. I would rather budget high and have extra cash to put in an IRA or I-Bonds.

My family's current food expenses are around $750/mo and I can probably cut that to $400 on my own. Internet/cell phones is $200/mo, subscriptions need to be calculated but I can cancel most of them (lets say $50/mo for entertainment), musical instrument rentals for the kids is $100/mo, clothing/shoes lets say $1,200/y for the fam (but probably much less), plus car insurance and rx copays and whatever, average $1,000/mo±(?)

I don't have much historical data to support this number. Maybe set it to $1500 to be conservative, plus another $500/mo for cleaning services and I have $4k cash coming in. How much of that can go towards housing? How much monthly mortgage payment can I afford?

Google mortgage calculator says a $500,000 house with 10% down, 30y fixed at 7%APR with good credit (mine is 750-800), $10k/y prop tax, $2500 insurance, $50/mo pmi (rocket?) comes out $4,085/mo payments. My salary+bonus is 125+15% (~143) so monthly that's just under 12/mo. Housing would be 33% of gross.

Reasonable? Save another 6 months? Work budget down to half? What's the best plan? Renting does not feel like a responsible option because a 2br apartment around here is approx $2500/mo which might get me a $350k house... but houses in that price bracket are more volatile. If I can push into the 600-800 range, they appear (historically) much more stable. (the $350 houses were $125 in 2019, but the $800 houses were $600 in 2019. Both could lose 250, but one is 25% and the other is 200%...)",1668965203.0

Any advice on helping parent?,7,ywgtao,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/ywgtao/any_advice_on_helping_parent/,8,"Hi all! I know you really can't help those who help themselves. So I guess the advice I'm looking for is from people who actually got thru to their parents. And if this isn't the best sub for this & have a better one to share, please do.

TL;DR: My mom doesn't understand money or how credit/loans work. Being ""current"" means she's paid the past due amount, while still leaving a balance. Any attempt to help her budget is met with ""I don't need your help. I'm not a child."" How do you help people like this? 

My mom is approaching 60 (parents divorced many many many years ago...basically I've never known married parents). She works an insane amount, in a job that is not kind to the body, but yet is always behind on bills. For as long as she's done this job, she doesn't qualify for supervisory roles because of her attitude. It's pretty entitled, tbh. One of those ""I'm not wrong. I just don't like their rules"" types. Nothing is ever her fault, etc. I can say that she does pay me back after a couple months when she borrows money. My biggest concern if she doesn't get her finances in order is that she'll basically work herself to death. Anytime I ask about her retirement plan, I'm met with ""that's none of your business"". Um, it IS my business if you're going to have to live with me Barbara. I need to plan for that, because at present I'm not. 

When I do help her with money, I always tell her that we need to sit down and figure out her budget. I know she can live a comfy life based off the area she lives in & her salary as it's comparable to mine, and I have zero struggles (not because they don't exist but because I realized early I was starting to use her same bad habits, i.e. insane credit card use). Her response each time is ""no, we're not doing that. I'm not a toddler."" Well no shit, but here we are again; you asking me for thousands of dollars because you don't seem to understand that ""Past Due"" and ""Current Due"" are 2 separate things. I just got finished sending her $1200 to get her car note current. She kept saying her balance was $0 & she wasn't sure why she owed any money. Turns out the past due balance was $0, but she still owed 2 balloon payments because she pushed 2 payments to the end of her loan, plus some fees. It is a very predatory loan, honestly, but looking more into it, it seems like it's her own doing for the position her loan is in. BUT YOU CAN'T TELL HER THAT! Because it's not her fault...it's never her fault. And it's annoying.

Is there any help for a person like this? Do any of you have the same parents & were able to ACTUALLY get thru to them?",1668564916.0
Advice for current state of finances?,2,yvnj4v,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/yvnj4v/advice_for_current_state_of_finances/,4,"Hi everyone. I'm moving to a new place next month, my first apartment by myself. I've been doing some research and trying to learn how to do a budget. I'm planning on using a paper notebook in combination with Mint's free version for my budget, but I wanted some advice. It's not super pretty, but here's where I'm at:

Income:

* Pre-tax/deductions: $3862.87 last 2 paychecks
* Post-tax/deductions: $2029.40 last 2 paychecks

Static monthly:

* Rent/utilities at new place: $1534.50 (base rent $1225, all utilities flat rate every month bundled with rent plus fees and sales tax)
* Dog's medical debt: $230 per month, final payment Feb 2024, no interest
* HYSA auto saved: $100 per month

Other:

* Planning $150/month gas rounded up
* Car insurance is average $700 for 6 months at a time (January/July)
* Owe \~$2150 on credit card - want to pay this off ASAP while still saving
* Occasional side income from selling belongings I no longer need or turning in scrap metal for cash: \~$50 every 2-3 months on average

My income is salary plus an average of 1 hour each week at $30 per hour, paid biweekly. Soon it'll be an average of 2 hours per week at $30 per hour, and I have occasional opportunity for an extra hour here and there also at $30 per hour. I'm leaving my second job for health reasons and will soon be able to add $270 back to the post-tax total (paychecks from the second job are not enough to balance out required extra tax withholding any more thanks to health issues that led me to cut hours there). The deductions I mentioned under income include insurance (health/dental/accident/pet), union dues, HSA deductions, and mandatory 12.15% to retirement.

I own my car outright, and my family is handling my student loan payment and my phone bill for me. While my new place is more expensive, I'll be saving myself a lot of money on gas by moving closer to work. I don't have a food budget for myself and my dog established yet, because I'm working on breaking my impulse buying at the grocery store and am not sure what an average month should be quite yet. I'm in a high cost of living area, and my current income is my starting income at a new career. I have potential for salary increases each year based on performance and education. I'm open to taking on a second job again when I have my health back under control.

I've lived in apartments for a while, but my roommate is moving out. I can't afford to keep our current place by myself, and I wasn't able to find a new roommate in time. It was better for my situation to get an apartment alone closer to work. I've spent the past year slowly building a sinking fund account for my car insurance and am close to having a year's worth in it, but my normal savings account is dwindling. I'm working on poor spending habits that are definitely making things harder than they need to be, but I was hoping some brutal honesty here might help some more.",1668488791.0

&#x200B;

Essentially the budget is dynamic and you can tweak it as your expected income and expenses change throughout the month and based on the current day of the month it allows you to save the net amount you should have at the end of the month. There are some groupings as well for say a mortgage or rent to include the other components of each if you pay for internet utilities etc.

&#x200B;

The formatting of it is pretty clean, just finished a 6th rendition of it. How do I go about sharing it so people are able to see what it looks like?

&#x200B;

Also in mine, google sheets has the option to include stock tickers as well so I use that to monitor activity in the stock market and see current prices. Hard to detail the master one that I use compared to the template itself as I have other sheets in the document that connect and plug into it.

What to do with Tax Refund?,1,yq7gca,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/yq7gca/what_to_do_with_tax_refund/,5,"Hi Everyone,

I am hoping that this is an appropriate subreddit to post in. I have also posted in AusFinance but I was hoping I could ask here.

English is my first language but my dyslexic a$$ always makes grammatical and spelling mistakes even after proofreading - so please bear with me.

As a USA citizen living Australia, I am required to do Expat taxes and report everything to the IRS - which I do after filing my Australian tax return and I just recieved my USA refund that is 1400USD ≈ 2100AUD.

I have a few debts I need to settle but would like some recommendations/advice on what to do.

1. I have to go to the USA next year and had to take a credit/loan of $4100AUD in September via Humm90 to pay for my flights. I brought it down to almost 50%, As of now I have $2190AUD to pay off.

2. My phone bill is $220AUD per month because I signed up for a 3 year contract  for two phones in November 2020. One phone for me and one phone my for my ex parter - Due to his financial situation at the time, he could not put a phone contract under his name so we put all phones under my name and he would just pay me his part when we were together. I can cancel at anytime and would love to stop paying $120 for his phone on top of my own, however I would have to payout the phone and additional $166.67 as the phone company had a “deal” where you get $500 worth of items and pay it off with a 3 year contract - I did not take the “deal” but my ex wanted to so I agreed to it. My ex was paying his part for the first 4 months since we split but has not paid me in 2 months and I would like to payout the phone so that I can just pay my own phone bill. I haven’t cancelled it because previously I did not have enough money to pay it out. I think to payout just his phone it is $800AUD. I have gone NC with my ex for my personal safety and would rather not reach out to him. Otherwise I can keep paying $220 until November 2023 and cancel all phones and switch to a Sim only plan.

3. My savings are super low - I did have some savings but life has not been kind as of late in these last two months and had a few financial demands such as vet visits and car repair - car repair was brutal but cheaper than buying a new car.

One part of me wants to payout as much as possible on the flights so that I can put more money towards savings. (Pros & Cons - no more fat debt and can use income to put towards savings but won’t have left over money for savings and still paying the phone)

Another part of me wants to pay out $1100 AUD towards flights, pay out the phone and then the left over part will go into savings. (Pros & Cons - just under 75% of debt from flights will be paid off but still have $1090 left to go + plus fees, only have to pay my phone bill of $100 per month, tiny starting savings but at least it is there)

2 Income Household + Terrible at Money Management- Help!,14,yje6xl,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/yje6xl/2_income_household_terrible_at_money_management/,10,"My husband and I desperately need help on managing our monthly budget.  We are a two income household and make enough money + some to place in savings, use for entertainment purposes, etc and yet somehow are always still living close to paycheck to paycheck.  We are committed to beginning to slow down our extra spending and beginning to work our finances through a weekly/biweekly/ monthly budget, but just don't know where to start in terms of how others who manage their money well do this.  My husband is paid weekly, and I am paid biweekly, so I am wondering if anyone has advice on how exactly to go about this.  Here is what our finances looks like (this is all the expenses we could think of) 

Monthly Income: $8,100 (this does not include overtime pay my husband makes between May- November each year, the peak of his overtime is early Sept- Mid Nov, where he usually brings in an additional $300-$400/week) 

Weekly Income Breakdown: $925 per week from my husband, and $2200 every two weeks from myself) 

Monthly Expenses: 

Mortgage: $2065, Internet/ TV Subscriptions $148, Gas $100, Water/ Sewage/Garbage $150, Electricity $60, Cell Phones $240, Dog Food $120, 3 Credit Card payments $500 total 

Weekly Expenses:

Daycare: $240, Groceries $200, Gas $60 

&#x200B;

My math brings me with an additional $3,193 a month that can be used toward savings + extras, which truly blows my mind and is probably being primarily used up on useless shopping, ordering out food, etc. Some of this can come from a surprise medical cost from time to time, but most of it is irresponsible.

One of the biggest hurdles faced with every frugal person... is the problem of organization. This challenge makes it hard to stick to a budget and stay in financial control. Organization is the panacea to spending money on conveniences. When someone is organized, when someone is productive and efficient, a whole lot more gets done than when he is not organized. and the step to take to pass it is to have a system. Systems help save time and sanity. They help you plan and prepare ahead of time so that you are organized when you don’t have time. and the most powerful organizational habit is to simplify. To let go of the many things that don’t really need to be done so that you can focus on the most important things.",1666700931.0

First time on bi-weekly pay schedule…,1,yacrw9,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/yacrw9/first_time_on_biweekly_pay_schedule/,13,"Let me lead all of this by saying that I am incredibly blessed to have the job I have and any bother associated with pay schedule is a great problem to have in the grand scheme of things.

I may be alone in this, but, as a salaried employee, 26 pay periods per year is NOT my favorite… Can anyone explain why employees would prefer no-weekly over semi-monthly???

For context, I’ve only ever been on semi-monthly payment plans before (always paid twice every month on the same days of the month), and it is wonderfully predictable. Every month I can afford, or not afford, the exact same things.

On this new budget, I basically see three ways to go:

1) Pretend my “lower” average payments are all I make and treat the “extra” two payments as happy surprises for savings. I don’t like this at all personally.

2) When I get an “extra” payment one month, squirrel it away, divide it by six, and every following month add 1/6th to that month (I’m too particular I know I can’t help it). I lean towards this, especially as December will be the first applicable month and I can start cleanly with the new year.

3) Build that extra paycheck into my savings plan and deposit less into savings each month. Not my favorite, as this ignores the possibility of job loss (incredibly unlikely, but still) or unexpected events.

9 Tips that have Saved me some Cash,13,y8z6s1,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/y8z6s1/9_tips_that_have_saved_me_some_cash/,0,"If you are feeling the burn OUTSIDE of the gym, you might be a victim of inflation nation. Let’s talk tips to keep a few, or maybe even many, extra dollars in your pocket. You earned it, don’t give it all away.

The Big Three

When talking about saving money, there are thousands of little things that can save you a buck or two, but you may be better served by looking for the bigger wins.

My first 6 tips come from what I am going to refer to as the “BIG THREE”: Housing, Transportation, and Food. On average, these three categories tend to take up a good portion a monthly cashflow.

ROOMMATES Nothing says “I’m an adult” more than having your own place. Well, except maybe being able to pay your bills. Especially in locations where rents are high, adding a roommate to your household can be a huge win. For all my fellow introverts out there, I know it can feel like a big sacrifice, but adopt a roommate you really love, or one who has a different schedule than your own. You might find you have the place to yourself more than you anticipated. I know this is a change that might be hard to make today, or even within the next few months, but keep it in the back of your mind as your lease comes up for renewal. (SAVINGS $400-$500/mo.)‍

TRANSPORTATION Even as we see a bit of a break in the gas price surge, it’s always a good idea to evaluate your transportation practices. If there is little flexibility in your options to get to work, like carpooling or biking, there is still probably some dollars to be saved on nights and weekends. Get thoughtful with your errands so you can knock them out in one trip rather than a nightly ride in the gas guzzler. For my city folk, skip the cab, and learn a new bus route. (SAVINGS $15-$40/mo.)‍

GROCERY STORE For those who don’t know, this is the place where you buy food to bring into your home, and then you can eat it whenever you want. Most of the time it’s cheaper, too! Get that store savings card, make a list, and look for products you enjoy that happen to be on sale this week. Even if, like me, you’re a creature of habit, don’t be afraid to choose a new brand of peanut butter if it’s going to save you a few bucks! (SAVINGS $50-$100/mo.)

Ok, I know the grocery store might not be as exciting as checking out all the newest culinary delights, so let’s get into some money savers when dining out. ‍‍ WHERE ARE YOU EATING?: There can be a big monetary difference between full service restaurants and places where you order at the counter. DO NOT save extra money by being a bad tipper! If you are choosing to eat at a restaurant with a waitstaff, calculate that extra 20% (or more) in your brain before you enter the door. If it’s going to be too much of a stretch to tip, be kind to our friends in the service industry and come back when it’s more doable. (SAVINGS $50-$200/mo.)‍

RESTAURANT EXTRAS: You can have a great experience, get a good meal, and be a generous tipper without having to break the bank. Restaurants love to catch you with the extras. Opt for water over alcohol or soda, share an appetizer, and maybe skip the meat tonight. You’d be surprised how much you can reduce the bill by choosing just one of these alternatives. Or do all three. (SAVINGS $50-$200/mo.)‍

FREQUENCY: If you are eating at restaurants every night, you might find the novelty wearing off quick, and your paycheck disappearing even quicker. Try to space out your trips to restaurants and maybe replace them with date nights cooking at home. If you are wondering where the food will come from, see above: (GROCERY STORE). (SAVINGS $50-$250/mo.)

‍Ok, let’s wrap this up with a couple of miscellaneous items outside of the big three. ‍ SUBSCRIPTIONS: If you are scrolling your subscription menus more than watching the content, it may be time to eliminate a service or two. If you want to go one step further, pull out those credit card statements and see if you have forgotten to cancel any subscriptions you no longer use. (SAVINGS $15-$100/mo.)‍

CLOTHING: Before you plan another shopping trip, take a deep dive into your closet and take stock of what you own and the frequency in which you wear your items. Remove things you doubt you will wear again and get yourself to a second hand store. (Trigger warning: selling your clothes at certain second hand stores can cause you to question all of your life choices.) If they decide your items are worthy of purchase, they usually offer you cash or store credit. Take a look around and your 5 unworn pieces might turn into your new favorite vintage shirt! (SAVINGS $15-$30/mo.)‍

CELL PHONE: “Hello? Can you hear me?” There is a lot of money to be saved here. With just a bit of research and no change in habit I was able to reduce my monthly cell phone plan from $118 to $35. Check out your previous data usage and question the need for the unlimited plan. WIFI is EVERYWHERE. Ask if your provider has a cheaper prepaid plan (all you’re really doing is paying on a different date), and try to take advantage of any loyalty programs. If you’ve exhausted all efforts, threaten to leave. It’s funny how often a new offer will suddenly “pop up” in these instances. Also, just because we have been placed into a system with a standard 2 year payment plan, does not mean you need to upgrade your device on this schedule. Think of your cell phone like a car: if it has a bad battery or a shattered windshield, replace the parts, not the whole! (SAVINGS $20-$80/mo.)

I believe if you take advantage of just a few of these tips, you might be surprised at how quickly you can free up between $150-$300/mo. without too much sweat.",1666274713.0

I make $30.27 an hour and $31.50 an hour when I work night shifts. I do make an average gross pay of $5500 per month or a bit higher.

*Mortgage: $1283. I do pay a little extra and my partner gives me $600 towards it also. 

*Car: $550, yes this is high but I chose to select a shorter payment plan. I pay $600.

*Groceries/Restaurants: $600 this number seems high to me but I guess it’s not that high with inflation. I also like to take my brothers out to eat every now and then.

*Miscellaneous: $600.. I used to give myself a lot less. This is used for clothes, house stuff, entertainment, gift giving any I don’t use I put towards either extra savings or an additional principal only mortgage payment

*Gas: $250 I have a 35 minute commute to work one way.

*Savings: 300 I don’t save as much as I used too I used to save a lot more but I decided to put more money to my mortgage and 401k. (Pre tax) 

*Electric: $70-200 it really fluctuates but I put aside $200 every month just in case. 

*Furniture: $200 a month.. I just bought two new couches, and side tables and a coffee table. I also got a 6 piece bedroom set because the one I had was 13 years old and starting to really fall apart lol. It definitely held up for me… this in total was $2500 that I put on a 15 month 0%apr card. This is my only balance on the card. I did this last month and I’ve been making additional payments it’s at $1770 now. 

*Car insurance: $113 is what the monthly breakdown would be but I pay 6 months at a time for full coverage and $500 deductible for a 2022 Kia K5

*Sewer: $30 average 
*Water: $20 
*Trash: $17.48
*Apple Music/ICloud Storage: 10.99
*Peacock: 4.99

I contribute 6% to my 401k and my employer matches that 6%  My employer also provides a pension.

However, I also want to track how much cash I'm spending and where I'm spending it, so I log those as transactions as well. But this means I'm double-recording the amount that I've spent, making my budget balance lower than my actual balance.

How to budget gifts of money received?,1,y5gnll,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/y5gnll/how_to_budget_gifts_of_money_received/,4,"Hi All,

I've been very carefully budgeting on a spreadsheet over the past year or so and am trying to improve my process. Recently, I received a gift of money from a generous relative to go toward investments, and I'm trying to determine how best to reflect this on my budget sheet. 

At the moment, my budget includes just my salary and any money I earn from side gigs or jobs. In the past if my grandma gave me $20 for gas or something, I'd include that, too, under an ""other"" category. But I'm not sure what to do with, say, a few thousand dollars given to me by someone, as well as any future inheritances etc.

I like being able to see exactly what I'm earning through work and what I'm doing with those earnings. Not that any money received isn't mine, but I feel like it would sway the budget and not make it as realistic, if that makes sense? Maybe this is a separate thing, actually, where I have a budget of my job earnings + all spending but can calculate networth differently?

Looking for any tips and suggestions anyone might have! Thanks!",1665926370.0

My Wife (F27) and I (M28) have joint finances. Generic break down is pooled income into a single account. A joint savings account. Two separate individual accounts that we allocate our allowances. Allowances cover all wants, all needs are met above and are joint.

I am trying to get her to see that $8,400/year, $700/month, is an absurdly high allowance, but given our ratios I caved at the current number knowing we are set for retirement and kids already. 

I’d much prefer $300-400/month, boost savings, vacation and our date budget.

I worry about finances and kids and want to live modestly. She doesn’t have many friends that she feels comfortable speaking with about finances, where as I help create budgets for families saving for their first home. I write mortgages part time after my day job which I don’t count in the budget.

I get humility from discussing finances with others for a living where as my wife is stuck in her bubble of it never being enough.

"Is this budget realistic? Also, is Ebenezer Scrooge *really* a bad example?",1,xqykae,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/xqykae/is_this_budget_realistic_also_is_ebenezer_scrooge/,4,"My spouse and I grew up with very distinct financial backgrounds. My view of money may not be healthy, and I’d like to get feedback on if the budget that we (mostly I) set is realistic.

**Family Background:**

My spouse didn’t come from a home with great financial managements. Her parents declared bankruptcy when my wife was young and often used payday loans for Christmas or to make ends meet. We don’t believe they’re preparing for retirement, but it’s not discussed.

My family was stable financially. My parents had been lucky early in their marriage and paid off their home mortgage in <5 years while working for a company that bubbled (and popped) in the 1990s. I estimate my parents earned about 40% more than the federal poverty line since my siblings and I would periodically lose (or regain) free school lunch. The budget was fairly tight, everything we bought was thrifted or from department store clearance aisles, but we never went without. To my knowledge, my parents never had debt after paying off their house. 

**Our Experience Budgeting:**

I’ve always been extremely tight fisted. When reading Charles Dickens’ *Christmas Carol,* I highlighted, “You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of \[poverty’s\] sordid reproach.” Because it sounded like a solid financial goal. I didn’t immediately realize it signified an **unhealthy** obsession. That’s meant a tight budget and *always* putting a little away. 

I don’t believe my wife ever created a budget before college. She afforded college, but often had very little money for food. “Running out” was a effective way to budget as she did not have a credit card. We married our senior year of college.

**Current Budget and Shortfall:**

Knowing that we have different backgrounds (and that my view of money may not be healthy) I’d love input on our budget. My spouse is a SAHM and does most of the shopping. However, we’re often over budget by several hundred dollars. I make up the short by not adding to our emergency fund (or in extreme cases) taking from it. We pulled $1000- from it each of the last three months and I’m getting concerned. Prior to 2021, our monthly income was 35% lower than it is now, and I’m afraid of hedonic adaptation.

**Tl;dr: is this budget realistic for a family of four? (Our kids are 7 & 4.)**

Hi all, 

I love love love budgeting, so I started a youtubechannel to do your budgets. You can see my first video here to get an idea of the concept: [https://youtu.be/He7Ux-sz\_9o](https://youtu.be/He7Ux-sz_9o) 

If you are new to budgeting (or know someone that could benefit from budgetting but doesn’t know where to start) this is a great first step in tracking your expenses. You can e-mail me ([ine.budgetnerds@gmail.com](mailto:ine.budgetnerds@gmail.com)) a cvs report (or pdf file) of one month of your expenses, I will sort it out and categorize it on my channel. I hope this will give you insight in your spending habits so you can choose what is important for you to spend money on in your life, and what isn’t worth it. 

Nerdly greetings,

I already have a condo which we currently inhabit.

The question recently arrived to sell this condo, even it it could mean a potential loss. Here is my current budget breakdown, I hope you can help me to take the correct decision:

&#x200B;

**Revenues (nets):**

Salary: 6090

Duplex rental: 2200 (taxes deduced in spending section)

Condo rental: 1800 (taxes deduced in spending section)

Other income (inc gf participation to the condo loan etc): 530

Total: 10620/month net

&#x200B;

**Real estate spending:** Loan, Taxes, Insurance, Fees, and income tax are included

Principal residency: 2397

Duplex: 2764

Condo: 3098

Total: 8259/month

**Health insurances and health funds (for both me and my pet):**

487/month

**Cost of living (food, transport, leasure etc):**

1250/month

Total spendings: 9996.***Average marging every month: 624$***

&#x200B;

Due to the raise in interests rates, I also have taken the decision to use my savings to make early repayments every weeks in order to lower the capital when renewal times come. It totals 450$/week and I have enough saving for the remaining of my terms (2 and 5 years) and still have 35k$ after those 5 years on those current savings.

I also have a few work perks:

\- I do not need a car, and my company provides us with food. Which actually decreases my cost of living.

\- We got company stock on a regular basis. At the current value it represent 3230$/nets every month. But the stock already crashed 80% and could go lower. This can either save me from any trouble, or be totally useless, which is why I did not take it into account in my budget.

&#x200B;

And concerns:

\- The current situation is not good, I could actually lose my job in a few months. I would find another one but would lose the perks.

\- My current interest rates are 1.89% for 3 years (duplex), 2.89% for 2 years (principal residency), and 5.29% for 5 years (condo). I am concerned the two low rates will renew at > 5%.

I am considering selling the condo, it could be done at null cost, or with a minimal loss (around 10/20k after tax credit) and cover this loss with the saved interest (I calculated a 24k$ net cost for this condo for the next 5 years). What do you think we should do ?",1663518945.0

I'm looking to change my spending habits and pay off my debts so I can also save money. Please give advice!

Some background: I make very little for a CA resident. I only make about 1600 a month. I rent a room. I have no dependents. I don't have a car. I only have one job at the moment.

Rent: 900
Phone: 50 
Credit payments: 200 minimum
**uber: ~400

Credit card debt total: 5k


I also pay for uber because I don't have a car or public transportation available to take to my job. It's also currently too hot to walk for an hour. But, sometimes I get rides from friends. Anyways, this number is about 400 a month. (This could change in the cooler months when I can safely walk or I get a car.)

I have like 100 in savings. That's it. 

As you can see I cannot afford groceries with this type of spending. So I use my tips to buy cheap fast food, eat pastries from my job, or fast. I do not qualify for Calfresh either, which used to help me in 2021.

I also cannot afford to save money or pay my debt in full yet. 

My goals are to eat healthy, pay my debts, and save money. 

My main obstacle is that I have a spending issue. I got the 5k debt from being a shopaholic. Spending money on material things like makeup, video games, and other nonsense really make me feel good in the moment. Once I saw the 5k debt, I obviously got buyer's remorse! Yet, it doesn't stop me from using my credit cards after only making minimum payments. 

Even besides the debt, I  use the app earnin to ""borrow"" from myself when I overspend which creates a cycle. I typically overspend on pay day and buy stupid gifts for my friends and myself for no real occasion other than I just wanted to.

I literally choose gifts and uber over groceries. You can see what my priorities are... it's sick. I do always pay my bills though. But the problem is that I cannot save any. What will happen on a rainy day? I won't have a savings to help me. 

I think my issue is that I don't think about the future enough. It's because I can't imagine being around long. But I really want to change that. PLEASE HELP.",1662445178.0

What I was previously doing was an uber driver . I requested to deliver by bike.I could rent a car weekly for maybe 350$ plus a 200 deposit (I'd usually make 1k a week driving full time). I was going to do that again but I got sick with the flu and had to use the money for my health.

If you return the car late its a 50$ fee plus you have to refill all the gas that you use and if you don't they will charge you even more than the cost of the gas. Usually I would make somewhere between 20-30$ an hour. So a 12 hour day I could make around 200$ especially on the weekend. An average 8 hour day would be around 150$.

I have been working a mobile personal financial application that I hope assists individuals better understand their cash on hand and ideally help individuals to also use their credit cards effectively (by treating them as cash and only spending what one can pay off at the end of the billing cycle).

Eating healthy is more expensive.,27,wx0xn5,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wx0xn5/eating_healthy_is_more_expensive/,11,"This might be controversial, but eating healthy is way more expensive than eating unhealthy. I'm not saying don't eat healthy, but ultimately, we need a certain number of calories per day to avoid losing weight. Sure, some of us can benefit from losing some weight, but you can't plan a food budget around being on a diet forever, you'll eventually get to your ideal weight. Then, you need to eat at a maintenance level of calories.

Everyone's maintenance level is different. Mine is a lean 2600, but some people are way higher. If I need 2600 calories per day and have a low paying job, I might simply not be able to afford veggies. They don't help me hit that number. I'm going to just focus on total calories, macronutrients, and fiber.

If I am very very poor, I am just focused on getting enough calories. I had a professor once who said that in Cuba, his parents gave him sugar water each day with that same logic. You can't live forever off it, but you can live for a while.

To be clear, I eat a healthy diet now, but I didn't always have the means to do so, and during that time, I got annoyed by nutritional experts who said eating healthy was cheaper because a cup of broccoli is cheaper than a cup of fried rice. Ok... but the fried rice has more calories. The broccolo doesn't do shit for preventing weight loss.

I see it like a hierarchy of needs:

50/20/30 Rule Question,3,wwd212,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wwd212/502030_rule_question/,5,"I've read a lot about the 50/20/30 rule in allocating your budget to categories to needs/savings/wants based on percentages of net income. However, I have created an extensive budget spreadsheet and am finding it difficult to calculate totals.

Whenever I read about the 50/20/30 rule, I always read that these percentages should be calculated using your after-tax (net) income. However, my net excludes money that I put into retirement, stock purchase and benefits (which are not taxed). So if I am leaving these out of the total net income, then I wouldn't be able to allocate part of my percentage goals within the needs (benefits) and savings (retirement/stocks) categories, and therefore would essentially be double counted in an overall total.  How should I fix this?

A. Do I just reduce the % total from each overall category?

For example: If I spend say 10% on retirement, 2% on stocks (total 12% of savings category) pre-tax, would that mean I now only have to set my allotted savings goal to 8% instead of 20%? Same for 10% out of my needs category to benefits and therefore only have a total goal of 40% instead of 50%; which would make my total budget 78% instead of 100% of my net income? But wouldn't that cause some issues because the % deducted from gross (of these) would not equal the same % of my net? I guess I could do a conversion equation but can't quite wrap my head around how to do that...

B. Or do I just keep the total 50/20/30 % goals and not include those $ totals at all? But this would disproportionately throw off my goals because then I would have a false surplus of 22% in my overall budget....

We have tried and tried to set budgets but it never works because there is nothing to actually stop us from spending on little things. We are low income, but it’s very hard for us to not just spend $15 on Taco Bell because “it’s only $15!” Or buying anything we “need” (aka want) from Amazon when it’s on sale. 

We like the idea of like cash-in-envelopes sort of budgeting (as seen on TikTok) but I’m nervous about just having large amounts of cash sitting around. I was thinking we could swap cash for re-loadable gift cards for each thing (a gas gift card, a grocery gift card, etc) but my wife made the point that that’s not very different from cash.

If this sounds interesting, we'd love for you to have a look. This is completely free right now, although the beta will expire after three months (and the app will be updated much sooner).

Help with a Rough Budget?,1,wphd2m,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wphd2m/help_with_a_rough_budget/,1,"Hello!

I’ve recently decided it’s time to crack down on my spending and try to start some kind of budget. Any help would be appreciated, as I know the basic totals but don’t know what to allocate elsewhere.

My gross yearly income is $33,280 (I make $16/hr in southwestern VA). I contribute 6% to my 401k each check, & I get paid bi-weekly. My credit score is on the low end (under 600). I’ll be rounding up to the nearest dollar if there is change.

Rent: $526
Car insurance: $161
Car payment: $260
Phone: $60
Internet: $83
Electric: Varies; $70-ish during the summer months, can jump to as high as $185 in the winter if I utilize heat.
Subscriptions/streaming: ~$50
Gas: $100 (just in case gas hikes up again)

Groceries is a struggle, as I am learning how to cook more (thanks boyfriend) & eat out less. I would budget around $150-$200 for this, ideally.

As of right now, I don’t have much in savings but I do have automatic transfers of $20 per paycheck headed to my savings account just so there can be SOMETHING. I will add more myself manually, if possible.

Get me off the fast food track,23,wly5nn,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wly5nn/get_me_off_the_fast_food_track/,14,"Hello all,
So I used to be a regular on what I call ""The fast food app circuit"". Basically, across all the major fast food brands, if you keep all their apps on your phone, there is usually always at least one crazy deal you can take advantage of for a cheap meal. One example is McDonalds currently offering a free crispy chicken sandwhich with a $1 purchase. So ofc I go and buy a basic hamburger for $1.39, add tomatoes and lettuce for free, and also opt for the deluxe cripsy chicken sandwich, grand total, $1.49 for lunch or dinner with tax.

I *HATE* cooking because it usually involves too many dishes, and groceries alone cost more then these deals, let alone the time spent washing dishes.

I need to get away from this because of health concerns, but it's so damn hard to say ""No thank you, I rather spend triple on my food *and* slave away in the kitchen for an hour to preparing something that tastes worse, is less satisfying, and will require me to wash dishes"".

I'm furious at the inflation of the cost of this and would hope someone out there has a very cheap way I can still get my laundry done.

How do you envelope budget & what tools / excel templates do you use?,1,wii294,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wii294/how_do_you_envelope_budget_what_tools_excel/,2,"My SO and I love envelope budgeting - it really works for us, but after doing it for a few years we keep on finding that the software we use falls short and ends up taking us days per month to maintain. We started by using Banktivity and now use MoneyWiz, but both just fall short and are buggy – especially when it comes to multiple currencies.

Our method is to import all our transactions from our various accounts (incl. foreign currency accounts), categorize them (into envelopes) and tag if needed (for special circumstances). Are you guys categorizing all transactions too?

I'm quite apt with Excel so have thought about building my own solution there, but when it comes to splitting of transactions things get a bit ... hairy. Also Excel isn't really built for 100s of lines of data, before getting laggy, so I also thought about going the SQLite route. All this is to say it would be a rather large time & effort investment in getting everything up and running and then to maintain it all.

I know a lot of people recommend YNAB – I've never tried it as it doesn't support accounts in multiple currencies - however if it really is that good maybe I can make it work.

Electric rates in Texas,1,wes5g7,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wes5g7/electric_rates_in_texas/,0,"TL;DR: If you're in a deregulated area in Texas/elsewhere, do the math on electricity rates - if you're renewing your retail provider plan, longer terms at rates slightly higher than shorter term plans may be the best option.

Background:

Time came for renewal on my electric plan so I looked up my prior rates/usage/average on my tracking sheet.  We use on average 1236 kwh/month, ranging from 850-1500 kwh (median usage 1200 kwh).

* In 2020, my one year plan through Frontier was 8.9c/kwh @ 1000 kwh (Eco Green 12).
* In 2021, my plan through 4Change was 7.2c/kwh @ 1000 kwh (Maxx Saver Bundled 12).
* My three-year plan this year through PlusPower is 15.5c/kwh, flat rate, no ""discount for > 1000 kwh.""

I chose a three year plan as I expect rates to continue climbing and I'd rather lock in / fix a budget now.  The best price overall I could find for our usage was 14.3c/kwh on a 24 month plan with the ""$100 discount for usage over 1000 kwh"" tag.  That forced reset two years out makes the difference in long-term value.

If electricity rates ""only"" go up by 25% over the next three years, I'll break even (they dropped between year 1 and year 2, then went up 100% year-over-year this year for a total two year increase of 75%).  They're primarily driven by the cost of natural gas right now in Texas.

If electricity rates go up by more than *just* 25% in the next *three* years, I'm saving money in the long run.  By then, the addition of solar + batteries will probably make financial sense with a shorter ROI than today.

My new budget for electric the next three years just increased by 50%.  Ouch... but small ouch, compared to things like property taxes, etc.",1659487238.0

This is something we've constantly argued about because for a long time, I stayed home with the kids and he was the only breadwinner. What should I do first?",1659288200.0

Today for the first time, I tired to audit the last month of our spendings by categorizing transactions to see how we are doing. It proved to be VERY difficult. With us consistently VENMO'ing each other for shared purchases/bills, and her having multiple credit cards, it became too confusing and I've given up for the day. It would probably be helpful to have her go through it with me, but I also had another idea. 

Could we just put aside the amount of money we want to save each paycheck and not worry so much about auditing the categories? If we have to pull from our savings to pay for things, then we know we overspent. 

One downside by doing it this way is that it would make it difficult to know how much we have left to spend in certain categories per month.  But man, I feel like I'm in way over my head with this.",1659195128.0

Monthly Budget Template.xlsx,2,wbre8v,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/wbre8v/monthly_budget_templatexlsx/,0,"Hi All,

I created an [Excel template](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oroa37oi54j5yp8rhp7j2/Monthly-Budget-Template.xlsx?dl=0&rlkey=j1y6ig20zcb6vilujw0pn8dn4) to help you track your income and monthly expenses.

Here's how to track your expenses:

* In the ""Net Income"" worksheet enter the expense category in the ""Expense Category"" column.
* Then in the ""Transactions"" worksheet enter the same expense category name in the ""Expense Category"" column (be careful with spelling) along with the transaction amount in the ""Amount"" column.

The SUMIF formula will take care of the rest.

I've provided a few example transactions to help you get a feel for how the spreadsheet works.

Each month simply save the spreadsheet as a new file, delete the transactions and start again.

This way at the end of the year you can add up all the category totals and see where you could possibly cut back on spending.

I hope this helps.",1659164641.0

I have been using a budgeting book for about 4ish months now and this month I have the least amount of purchases I've ever had and yet I have less than $5 in my bank account and  50 cents in savings. I just feel so defeated.

I haven't used my credit card in like 4 months and I even got a credit line increase out of nowhere but I'll be using it again in about 2 weeks because I have no choice. Last paycheck I went to get a check up on my car and come to find out that what was supposed to be a $30 trip is a $650+ trip and I couldn't afford it then so I only paid for a third and now I have to go back and pay the rest to get my car fixed all the way as I can feel how bad my car is and I pay rent next month and my rent just went up and my paycheck is not going to be able to cover both- nowhere near. 

Which means I'll have to play catch up every single paycheck after that. I'm not even celebrating any holidays this year bc I can't afford it. I have only eaten out twice this month and each time was less than $10 purchase . I'm eating pb&j's for lunch everyday with one slice of bread so I can stretch out the loaf as much as I can. I only have a $10 Spotify subscription. I pay my CC bill every month but I still can ever afford the minimum which I know is just really  not even paying off the card

I have been poor/in poverty my whole life and I thought getting away from my family and going to college would get me away from that (I picked a horrible degree for money but In my defense, growing up where I did they don't teach you about degrees and what gets you money;  they just teach you to get out of here and go to college before you get stuck although that's no excuse I am to blame). I just feel like no matter how hard I try, nothing changes. I'm still just a poor girl who is just acting like she's got it handled and I don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry for complaining, any advice or tips in playing the catch up game with my paychecks I think would be nice, I I think I just needed to rent because I don't have anyone else to talk to

budget advice,2,w5h2hm,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/w5h2hm/budget_advice/,1,"So I just got my first job after college! I want to budget for it appropriately as I understand the importance of doing so. I haven't actually started yet so I don't know what my actual monthly income will be this is just my best estimate. Same goes for most of my expenses. They're only estimates and likely will end up being lower than the actual values I have for them. Lastly, I am very aware that my estimate for gas and groceries are very high but I will end up having a long commute to work (about 1 hour one direction) and to the city (30 minutes one direction). As well as just moving in to a new place starting fresh I feel like my groceries will at first be quite high as I settle in. I would rather overestimate than underestimate. So without further adieu here is my monthly budget:

Monthly income: $4563
Phone: -$60
Car insurance: -$200
Gym: -$65
Rent: -$1500
Income leftover: $2738

Emergency fund: $300 (until there is $6000 saved)

High yield savings: $200

Checking:
    Groceries: $500
    Gas: $500
    Entertainment: $338

Savings: $900


So I was informed that it's not a good idea to have money in a bank account for an emergency fund and high yield savings since inflation will outpace the interest rates on them and instead use my credit card maximum as my emergency fund and invest into real estate. I want to hear second opinions though and if you guys think I should do something different with my budget I'm all ears.

How to categorize travel/other big purchases on budget spreadsheet?,6,w0ffqc,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/w0ffqc/how_to_categorize_travelother_big_purchases_on/,7,"Hi Everyone,

I have a very particular budget sheet question that is probably me just over thinking things, but here I am. 

I made my own spreadsheet and it really works for me, but I'm not sure how to exactly write out/keep track of my travel expenses, which is where most of my ""fun"" money is spent. I set aside money every month to save for travel (I do quite a bit of it) and have a running total saved, which is good, but I also like to keep track of how much I actually SPEND every single month (including on travel) and so want to fill out my main spreadsheet with every single purchase. That includes flight tickets purchased on a given month, and the hotel charges when you actually travel a month later or what have you. 

What happens, then, is I'm not quite sure what my ""travel save"" category is *doing* on my spreadsheet since I've already paid for and tracked all my travel expenses as I go. For example: had a trip to the UK a month ago. I bought the ticket back in March, that was counted as a ""travel"" expense in March. Picked up a new bag for it in April, so a travel expense in April. Then in May / June were the actual hotel charges, food expenses, etc when I was there. I just tracked it all every day like I normally do, and ended up with like only $100 leftover after expenses for the month of June... Even though I technically had x amount of money saved since January for the trip, and that I had put in a separate account and that shows up as part of my net income on my spreadsheet (ie, say you have 5k total net since January and you designated 2.5k of that as toward travel). 

Anyway, so I guess my question is: how else can I be categorizing this on my spreadsheet? Importantly, I want to know how much money I am actually spending on travel as a category, which is why I count it on my spreadsheet with my regular monthly expenses.

I'm a bit confused on the best way to track my credit card payments and transactions for my monthly expenses. I primarily use my credit card to pay for things each month, and then I pay it off each month, so it zeroes out (usually). when i'm filling out my budget sheet for each month, it feels like it's double counting my transactions and the card payment.

in my head, the transactions don't really count because it's a line of credit and it's my payment that is the true expense. however, only tracking the credit card payment doesn't show the break down of what my expenses were. 

can someone explain in layman terms how credit payments fit into a budget?

Sorry that is so long but I didn’t knew how to write it shorter 🥺
Basically I’ve never had a some financial education or some good financial example in my family cause we lived in a poor country in East Europe and were basically living on a bare minimum.
I moved to Europe at 18 y.o. and started to earn money but also spend it on everything I could buy and wanted to buy since I was a child, I think some kind of trauma.
I was also taking loans that I am paying till now. I know I was really foolish and stupid.

So about my situation a lil bit: I am a full time student with a mini-job. 
My parents also help me to pay the rent.  
Basically I have every month from ~1200 till ~1400€.

My fix bills are:
-Rent 600€
-Insurance 110€
-Phone 110€
-Gym 25€
Total 845

Also every month I give around 100€ for my credit cards. One is in -1500€ and other one is in ~600€. 

So now the total is 1.045€.
I’ll be left with 255€ if I become an average of 1300€.

My question: is it possible somehow with such a low income to even save some money and buy groceries and the minimum bathroom supplies? 
Or maybe anyone has some advice to pay my credit cards really fast? 

I have really bad sleeping problems and anxiety because of this and I don’t wanna ask for more money from my parents. 

Maybe someone has some advices??

EV v ICE - I made a dumb choice!,0,uxkl5u,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/uxkl5u/ev_v_ice_i_made_a_dumb_choice/,0,"Back in October we purchased an 18 plate Peugeot on PCP agreement, of 350 per month over 48 months. 

We’re trying to figure out what is the best option for us to swap over to a used EV up to 22k value, as this would save us approximately 300 pcm provided we can place down there 4K deposit we need to get our monthly payments at a similar rate to what we currently pay. I’m planning to leave work and retrain next September, which will decrease our household income by 50k per yea, cutting our costs is crucial to this being possible. And not having a car also isn’t an option as the cost of commuting would be far beyond car ownership.

Our early settlement at this point is still only  18k for obvious reasons.
Valuations from dealers are coming in around 12-13k, leaving us in a negative equity, situation at the moment. Partly due to the ongoing decrease in popularity of diesel cars, increasing fuel prices and general trend towards EV.

I had hoped for around 16k trade-in, meaning we would be left with around 2k pay out of our current agreement, and the 4K left over as a deposit towards our new car (used EV) on a new PCP agreement.

Looking online (autotrader), it seems we could get around 16-17k on a quick private sale, provided the finance company agrees it. But I am fairly new to car ownership and wanted to check I wasn’t getting into a foolish situation.

Our final option is to buy a used ICE vehicle which works out the cheapest option, if you exclude unexpected repair bills. And with a prospective low income I do prefer to reassurance of an EV with less potential for things to go wrong.

Some details on me: I am married and have four kids. I am the sole provider of income and make $87.5k a year base with anywhere from 15-20k in overtime and bonuses, on average. But the overtime fluctuates and isn't guaranteed. I have been at my job for 5 years and started off at about 60k. I have a couple problems with my budget:

1. without overtime, I don't have what I need each month. Even though overtime isn't guaranteed, it has been consistent enough that I haven't had problems coming up short for the month, but it concerns me all the same. On paper, it looks like I am in the positive each month, but misc. expenses like clothes, personal spending, and other things that aren't monthly expenses (like rent) are what usually puts me in need of overtime.
2. I am not currently tithing as much as I want (not important to some, but important to me) and I am not invensting in retirement. Well, I am, but only like 4 or 5% into my 401k.

 I have some things automatically come out of my paycheck such as union dues, health insurance, healthcare reimbursement card, etc. Those aren't in the budget since they are paid automatically from my paycheck.

* Quicken - excellent bank integration but horrific budgeting software. This is what I'm currently using.

Should I stay or try to find someplace else? I have limited options right now because there isn’t like another town close by here I could move to. Texas sounds great but damn shit is far away.

Edit for an update: found an apartment not too far from where I am right now, rent is going to be about $150 cheaper than what the current place wants to charge me, so I’m moving in August. Once the dust settles, my budget will be so I can save about $300 a month while paying off the rest of my debt. I may take a few of those dollars and throw them at the car to pay it off sooner, not sure yet. Also am scheduled for a modest salary increase come Sept. so things are looking slightly better.

**Total monthly income**

* Parents: $1500
* Job: $400
* Doordash: $0-$150+


**Monthly expenses:**

*Essential*

* Rent: $700
* Power: ~$100
* Wifi: $65
* Amazon: $8
* Spotify: $10
* Gasoline: ~$150 (can vary significantly based if I doordash or drive somewhere far away, etc)
* Groceries: $200? 
* ***Total: ~$1250 (rounded for simplicity)***

$1900-$1250 = $650

Lets say I start saving $250 monthly

1. **Historical data.** What has happened in the past years, previous experiences and knowledge of previous sales trends. 
2. **The business aim and business objectives.** The budgets will need to complement the [business aim](https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/the-business-aim-in-details/) and its [business objectives](https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/business-objectives-in-details/). If future expansion is planned, budgets will need to reflect this. The [business objectives](https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/business-objectives-in-details/) need to be expressed in terms of sales revenue, market share and ultimately profits.
3. **Available sources of finance.** Any business budgets must be realistic as firms cannot spend more than they have the funds available.
4. **Negotiation.** Budgets should be set though discussions leading to consensus among the workforce. A business manager will only feel responsible, if there is agreement when the budget is set.
5. **Benchmarking.** A firm may set budgets that reflect the industry’s best practices and are in line with business organizations of similar [business size](https://www.superbusinessmanager.com/measuring-business-size/). Any increase in the overall promotion budget by one of the firms will be quickly matched by the other competitors.

I redid my budget today to include things that I want to get or need to get and it made me feel so much better.,15,u0uh1n,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/u0uh1n/i_redid_my_budget_today_to_include_things_that_i/,3,"Hi! 

Originally I set a strict budget for myself that left very little room to get the things I want/need until I finished putting money toward my emergency fund. My goal was to have $8,000 put away by the middle of October (actually, it started out by the beginning of July).. But things kept popping up.

I just redid my budget to include the things I want and need this year and extended my goal of having my emergency fund complete by December 29th.

I'm sharing this because, unless you have a hard deadline for something, I think it's important to be reasonable with yourself, leave room in your budget for the things you want/need, and don't deprive yourself.

Depriving myself and creating such a strict budget just created more stress for myself because every time I had to dip into my savings for something or overspent in a category I felt bad about it.

With this new budget.. I'm much less likely to dip into my savings and less likely to overspend in categories.

That is all I wanted to share. Just be generous with yourself while still meeting your budget and financial goals. That's my advice.",1649634958.0

"Budgeting for additional income from new job ($1,000/month)",5,u0u1ne,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/u0u1ne/budgeting_for_additional_income_from_new_job/,7,"I would love others' perspectives on this, especially if you budget the same way that I do. I am not sure if I am being realistic with my expectations here re: how far my new income will take me, if I should consider re-arranging amounts any, what you would recommend and what you have done in your experience, etc.

**My budgeting method:** I used to use an Excel spreadsheet that I set up for myself just to do basic tracking and goal measuring, then I moved to loosely tracking and re-arranging my budget on my phone just using a note app. Finally, I stopped tracking beyond checking my bank accounts every other day, and practicing mindfulness and minimalism (in other words, I consider my purchases more carefully, and when I see my checking account go down below a certain range I really tighten up on spending until my next paycheck). I also use my credit card to pay for a lot of things, and I completely pay off whatever is on it every few days (this helps give me back some money every month with rewards). It has been working for me for several months now, and is a lot less stressful for me. I am also that ""make more money"" kind of gal vs ""maximize your current budget"", and so I am also planning on making even more money in the next 1\~3 years, depending on promotions, etc. The way I spend money is: all bills are on autopay and I have reminders for myself on the 1st of every month to get those taken care of right away; I have a humble amount of $ that is set to automatically move from checking to savings for an emergency fund every time my paycheck hits the bank; I have an HSA and 403b through work that is deducted and distributed before my paycheck hits my bank; again, everything else I put on my credit card and I pay it off every few days; every once in a while I will go through month by month and think on what subscriptions and services I do not use and what I can cancel.

**The $1,000 distribution:** I just got a new job (hurray!) and I'm very happy because I think it's a +35% total increase to my income (hard to calculate because I'm moving from hourly to salary, plus benefits will cost a bit more). Taxes and benefits considered, I \*THINK\* I will be getting $1,000/month more ($500/pay check). I won't actually have a solid feel for my new income amount until those paychecks start hitting the bank, but I thought it would be best to give these extra $$$'s a specific purpose and set it up on auto-payments/movements to maximize them (instead of just throwing them into the mix and tempting myself to spend more). The planned spread right now is:

* \-$200/month for student loans (and I anticipate that as I make more money in future positions, I will add more to this amount; I am currently not paying my student loans down yet)
* \-$500/month for a future-oriented savings fund (house down-payment, etc.)
* \-$100/month for emergency savings (this would be in addition to what I am putting away now automatically; this is just my general savings account for emergencies, but I also use it for medical costs and as my ""X-months of income"" savings)
* \-$200/month for a travel fund (I really enjoy traveling and rarely get to leave my state, and I figured this would be a nice goal to save up for and use to make once or twice a year 'big' trips to other states or even other countries... but realistically, $2,400 for a big annual trip does not seem like a lot)

I guess my main concern is the travel fund. Should I just admit I do not make enough yet to take big fancy trips, and move the $200/month into a better purpose? Right now I live comfortably and I can order out and eat whatever I want, go on weekend trips, go do fun things around town, etc. But I also feel very far away from being able to afford a house, take big trips, etc.",1649633624.0

Now I can’t seem to get back on track. 

Every time I try to restart, I forget some part and lose momentum, then have to start over again. 
My main new job pays monthly, so it’s a lot harder for me to understand my limits now, and I’ve run my credit card up a bit (not super high, I have a low limit because I know myself). 
My second new job pays weekly, but gives me very few hours because I’m not “available enough” because of my other job.

How should I track expenses when I’m buying different categories under one receipt (like meds and clothes and food all sold at Walmart for example)?

Also another expense that varies is my medical/dental/vision expenses. I currently have insurance for all 3, but my insurance will be changing and I will no longer have dental/vision unless I buy it independently but I desperately need to get a vision exam and new glasses (it's been 3yrs and my vision gets worse every year) as well as several fillings done, crowns, root canals, and god knows what else (i'm pretty poor and have been putting it off for a long time). I also recently got a mental health diagnosis and could use counseling/therapy but because of the cost i've been avoiding it. I do have a prescription but the cost of that will change too with my change in insurance. Also random stuff that comes up out of the blue like fees for toll booths (sporadic use), fees for prof. conferences/school trips + food while gone (college student). 

Generally speaking, medical/dental care and unexpected vet bills have been what I struggle with the most and unfortunately they usually end up accumulating balances on my already high credit card balances.

"If you're using a spreadsheet, what apps have you tried and why did you decide not to use them?",11,t0fd17,budget,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/t0fd17/if_youre_using_a_spreadsheet_what_apps_have_you/,16,"I'm asking specifically the people that use spreadsheets because I'm really interested in the budgeters that are so into it that they are willing to pour a lot of time into it and have developed a lot of their own style and opinions. That's not to say that casual budgeters or people just learning are not equally important. It's just that I'm trying to understand better a pretty narrow demographic.

I'd like to know what was the deal breaker for each app to make you walk away and say, ""Nope, the full control of a spreadsheet is worth the pain of a spreadsheet."" As a bonus, feel free to add in things in apps that you were willing to put up with but you wish were different. I'll add mine as a comment.",1645720943.0

I currently have just over 16,000 in undergrad debt. My current savings is 13,000. I plan to make 7500 in the next 5 months to pay off 6,000 on my student loans, and then have 4,500 pocketed for student fees. So then I would have 10,000 in debt and 10,000 in savings for emergencies and 4,500 to pay my fees over the next two years. Does this sounds doable? My current job I make 10.50/hr plus tips…",1645758875.0
