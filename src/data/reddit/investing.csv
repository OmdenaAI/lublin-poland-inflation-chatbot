"Annual year-end explanation for large, unexpected drops in your mutual fund. Read this before making your own post please.",286,zs1idl,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zs1idl/annual_yearend_explanation_for_large_unexpected/,36,"A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds:[https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates)Ctrl + f your fund family.

So many posts related to Tesla these days, I thought the results of this survey carried out by Der Spiegel would be interesting, in particular for Americans who maybe don't read European media. There are graphs/data on the article page itself.

*Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany* (14/12/2022)

https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/der-spiegel-survey-musk-destroys-tesla-image-in-germany-a-fcc01ca2-d5fe-4c57-ac11-b48a560771f7

Germans have a disastrous view of Tesla, with company founder Elon Musk's behavior hardly helping. Whether from a likeability or quality perspective, the Tesla brand is far behind its German competitors. 

Elon Musk, it would seem, is eager to drag his followers into the abyss of conspiracy theory credulity – but is anyone taking the bait? The top dog of Tesla and Twitter has never been shy when it comes to polarizing statements, of course, but even by his standards, the last several days have been disturbing for his willingness to make right-wing positions his own. He went after the U.S. virologist Anthony Fauci, he has made light of people who want to determine their own sexual identity and he has generally declared war on ""woke."" During an appearance in San Francisco, Musk was booed for several minutes, and actor Billy Baldwin launched a trend with the hashtag #BoycottTesla.

In Germany, the calls for boycott were hardly necessary. That is the clear message of a survey conducted on behalf of DER SPIEGEL by the public opinion research institute Civey. Some 47 percent of the auto enthusiasts surveyed responded that Musk’s current behavior has had a ""clearly negative"" influence on their opinion of Tesla. An additional 16 percent said their reaction has been ""rather negative."" Only 3 percent said they have a ""rather positive"" impression of Musk’s recent behavior, and an additional 6 percent rated their impression as ""clearly positive."" The survey was carried out between Dec. 1 to 9, prior to Musk’s most recent outbursts.

In late October, after Musk took over control of Twitter, a number of public reactions already began indicating that the image of Tesla, the world’s leading electric car brand, was taking a beating. Alena Buyx, chair of the German Ethics Council, said at the time that she was no longer interested in buying a Tesla. ""It’s something you can’t do anymore,” she said.

In the U.S., the public opinion research company Morning Consult reported that Tesla’s popularity has suffered a nosedive primarily among supporters of the Democratic Party, which have traditionally dominated the e-car market. Since the beginning of the year, trust in the Tesla brand had been trending downward only slightly, says Morning Consult, but that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter ""acted as a break in the dam."" Elon Musk’s polarizing personality, the consulting company found, is negatively impacting Tesla.

The new survey commissioned by DER SPIEGEL has now revealed the same impact on the company’s image in Germany as that seen in the U.S. – just nine months after the carmaker opened up a new gigafactory outside of Berlin. And in contrast to the U.S., where Tesla seems poised to replace at least some of its disaffected supporters with new fans among pro-Trump Republicans, the same dynamic is nowhere to be seen in Germany. The broad rejection of Musk’s persona is apparent across all age, professional and educational groups in the country and it is independent of gender, region, family status, degree, religion and political affiliation.

The only exception is among those who proclaim to be supporters of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), with only 35 percent of such respondents saying they had a negative reaction to Musk’s behavior. But even within this group, the negative reactions outweighed the positive (23 percent).

Even without explicit mention of Musk, only 9 percent of Germans said they find Tesla to be ""very"" or ""rather likeable."" Fully 69 percent, by contrast, said they found the manufacturer to be ""less"" or ""not at all likeable."" That makes Tesla by far the least popular company among large carmakers with production sites in Germany, a finding once again independent of political party preference.

The survey revealed more polarization when it comes to Germany’s tradition-rich luxury brands like Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi, which are generally viewed negatively on the left side of the political spectrum, but more positively on the right, with center-left Social Democrats also showing a weakness for Audi. Mass producers like Volkswagen, Opel and Ford, by contrast, tend to be more balanced, or they trigger very little reaction at all. Only Tesla is viewed negatively across all political parties. Musk’s company generates the highest likeability ratings among university students (27 percent), those under the age of 30 (22 percent), voters for the far-left Left Party (21 percent) and civil servants (17 percent). In all cases, though, Tesla supporters make up a clear minority.

Tesla also isn’t able to rely on its aura of being a technological leader. In response to the Civey question as to whether respondents view the vehicles produced by the different brands as high-quality products, only 21 percent answered positively when it came to Tesla.

That value puts Tesla at the very back of the pack, behind even Ford and Opel, both of which are also produced in Germany but which belong to foreign companies. Traditional German producers received top marks on the quality question. But Tesla has also been the focus of numerous negative reports  in the U.S. when it comes to quality and safety, in part because of the disastrous press its driver assistance system has received.

The survey does not allow for conclusions to be drawn on general attitudes in favor of or against electric vehicles. Tesla is the only manufacturer on the list to specialize entirely in e-autos and leads the segment both in Germany and elsewhere in the world when it comes to the number of vehicles registered. But other brands are offering more and more battery-powered vehicles. From January to November, 52,000 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the KBA, the German agency responsible for motorized vehicle registration. That represents around one-seventh of all fully electric vehicles in the country, with VW hot on its heels.",1671967985.0

Avantis REIT allocation? Ginger Ale Portfolio.,10,zvee9x,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zvee9x/avantis_reit_allocation_ginger_ale_portfolio/,8,"I'm running a version of the ginger ale portfolio utilizing Avantis funds to create a portfolio similar to AVGE with less home country bias, a heavier value tilt, and a lower expense ratio. My portfolio is as follows...

- 25% AVUS (Total US Value)

• 25% AVUV (US Small Cap Value)

• 10% AVDE (Developed ex-US Value)

• 10% AVDV (Developed ex-US SCV)

• 10% AVEM (Emerging Market Value)

• 10% AVES (Emerging Market SCV)

• 10% EDV (Extended Duration Treasury Bonds)

Now AVGE does include AVRE since the other funds lack any real estate exposure. But SCV already gives you the factor exposure that drives real estate returns without the idiosyncratic risk of real estate.

I have two accounts:

2. A Roth IRA with \~11 shares of VTI, 6 of which were purchased in the last 30 days

Are people reading too far into Tesla’s stock losses?,402,zudt25,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zudt25/are_people_reading_too_far_into_teslas_stock/,439,"Their share price has declined considerably over the past year. Part of that is obviously due to a general decline in equities, with the s&p500 down 20% this year. More of that is due to the general decline in tech stocks (which is what Tesla is generally regarded as), as the nasdaq is down 33% this year. But Tesla went even further than that, and is down 66% this year. 

The reasons people ascribe to this are generally either that the company is in trouble or that it’s because Elon isn’t there to right the ship (or both). But what if Tesla was just dramatically overpriced and it’s only now coming down to earth as first time retail investors who pumped money into stocks irrespective of fundamentals or even sound qualitative reasoning exit the market (which for the past 2 years held, by %, an unusually large proportion of Tesla’s shares)? What if, in a poor macro environment, people have just lost an appetite for risky assets? 

What if, and I know this is speculative, a stock that people were paying $1100 for each $1 in earnings for in 2020 *may* have been overpriced?

On top of all of that, I think some may have overestimated the size of Tesla’s moat and how difficult it would be for other car makers to catch up, and also may have failed to consider the strain increased competition would place on the vital and not exactly abundant supply of inputs necessary to make EVs. But I don’t think this point must necessarily be true to explain Tesla’s share price decline given what I said above. But I do think to some extent the current explanations for Tesla’s share price decline are the result of our tendency to look for a single person to blame for adverse outcomes - although I am not entirely condemning this view in this particular case as Elon being stretched this thin and spending so much time at twitter is objectively cause for some concern.",1671901179.0

If you're running a profitable company, why not share the excess profits with employees / executives which have a much more significant impact on the performance of the company rather than paying dividends to share holders.

I understand that paying a dividend would attract more investors and most likely increase the price per share and if you're an employee who owns share, this also means they could sell their shares at a higher price, but not skip all of that and just transfer profits directly to employees?

One sector that I think of as promising in times of rising interest rates is the banking system. However in my bubble I have hardly heard of anyone betting on banks & financial industry segment lately. 

I find it quite plausible that institutional investors have to rotate out of stocks & real estate as those become more turbulent. Thanks to higher interest rates increasingly appealing banking & insurance products should be the first in line to scoop up investors money providing safe and stable investments. Therefore, profitability in banks & financial services should increase. 

I'm aware that banks also face defaults on their loans as some companies might go bankrupt. However, I would expect the banks secured profitability to outweight the risks.

Since banking stocks have not spicked significantly for the last year it seems the financial market does not evaluate the situation as I do.

I've heard that you can contribute an additional $6,500 to a backdoor Roth IRA, but I'm a bit confused about this.

It was my understanding that in order to do the mega backdoor Roth 401k, you couldn't have a traditional IRA with a balance because it would trigger taxes. So, I had transfer all of my traditional IRA holdings into the pre-tax 401k plan before I could even do the mega backdoor Roth 401k.

If I'm not supposed to have a traditional IRA outside the plan, how am I allowed to contribute $6,500 to traditional IRA and then convert it to a Roth IRA? Is the rule that the traditional IRA can't have a balance at year-end, so any transfers need to be made before 12/31?

This might sound a little outrageous at first but hear me out.

Last Friday (December 23) some US economical data got released, one of them being 'Personal Spending'. Which had TEForecast of 0.3%, and the actual number was 0.1%. 

The government budget deficit increasing from 14.9% to 16.7% is worrying for the US economy, together with a decrease in business confidence (50.2 -> 49 , but these are numbers from Nov/22, with the Dec/22 ones yet to be released)

Below are my 2cents on a few areas I've been thinking about. Imo, the fed will not cut rates over the next year. Even with softening CPI, at best the FED will keep rates the same (lesson learned from the 70s double top).

Entrepreneurs, partnerships, reselling etc. Private ventures is at the top of my list atm, (investing in early stage businesses with a high enough margin of safety)

Housing Market:   
Prices have been coming down dramatically in the covid era havens (L.A., Atlanta, many parts of FL).  At today's 30yr fixed rate^(1) with 20% down, that equates to buying the house 2x over, (500k sale = +500k in interest accrued). Investment property makes sense given the circumstances (*know what a good deal is, or get lucky*) - I'm hoping to get super lucky and learn to spot a deal throughout the process. 

Stocks/Bonds:  
Sure, 401k contributions and a handful of names. Wasn't planning on exceeding 20% of allocations, but things  change. I am interested in hearing your thoughts!

Savings/CDs:  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't heavily invested here. So simple and financially irresponsible to choose a near 0% checking over a high yield savings for idle cash. I like Marcus by Goldman 3.20% as of today's date, bonus of 4.2% with their referral program^(2)

>Brokered CD's have been \~4.60% - 4.75% for 9-12 month CDs. For those wondering what a brokered CD is, search for it on Investopedia^(3), superior to opening a CD at your local bank. 

Crypto:  
I am far from an expert. I've bought BTC at $99 and well into the $50k range. All things considered, this hasn't outperformed any of the aforementioned for me, relative to the risk. I'll still dabble, but don't expect allocations to be more than 5%.

According to the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Tracker, there are currently 102 countries either researching, developing, piloting, or launching their own CBDC's. In 2020, that number stood at 35. Both Covid and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were driving forces that led to the increase in CBDC interest. 

CBDC's have either a retail use-case, where consumers can walk into shops and purchase goods, or a wholesale use-case, to help countries easily settle cross-border transactions. Research has shown that interest in wholesale CBDC's has nearly doubled since Russia's invasion of Ukraine following the most sweeping set of sanctions levied against a major economy. 

The dollar is involved in nearly 90% of foreign-exchange transactions, but only 60% of cross border transactions are actually denominated in dollars. The dollar is used as a stable intermediary between other currencies to manage risks and costs as cross-border transactions finalize (sometimes after days.) As far as I understand, being able to instantly settle cross-border transactions would remove currency risk and hence the need to have to hold transactions in dollars before they settle.

Roth 401K vs. Pre-Tax 401K Rationale,4,zsaj80,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zsaj80/roth_401k_vs_pretax_401k_rationale/,8,"So I am seriously contemplating switching to a Roth 401K (NOT ROTH IRA) from Traditional Pre-Tax 401K.  
Asking the group what I may be missing in my rationale . 

* 53yo/married - so I can max out at $30K
* $30-$50K in non-retirement post-tax investment contributions.
* 24% Federal Tax Bracket.
* Home paid off$700K in traditional IRA roll over and $300K in company 401K.
* $300K in after tax investments
* Annual expenditures - $125-150K

Here's my rationale -

I want to build out my tax-free retirement bucket as large as possible.  Assuming 12 years to retirement - I'll end with $2mm in pre-tax IRA/401K, $1M in after tax investment and $500K in Roth 401K.  I'm not counting the value of my home.   


For retirement disbursements - My plan is to do a 50-50 split from the traditional retirement funds and after tax investments, while letting the Roth ride. My hope is to be a bit more aggressive on the Roth investments to juice the RoR until I need to access it.  I plan to take some excess funds from the pre-tax and roll over to Roth.  If spouse and I take SS at 68 to 70 - I figure I can live this way for a solid 10-15 years before I really need to tap into the Roth.    


The other reason to build as much Roth assets as much as possible is to avoid the widowers tax for me or the wife later in life and/or limit the tax liabilities to the kids.

I'm thrilled that they're giving me the opportunity to do so but want to make sure I come prepared so what kind of questions should I ask? What features should I look for?


**EDIT:**

Here's what I've got so far:


1. Fees. What do you charge the company, what do you charge the employees? Are there fees for selling, reallocating?
2. How readily visible are fees for each offering? Employees should be able to easily compare.
3. Make sure there are Low-Cost Index Fund and Target Date Retirement Options. Are there diverse set of actively managed options as well? What are the expense ratios on these items? How do these offerings compare to your retail customers?
4. Self Service for employees to change contribution limits
5. What’s the window on when an employee can change their contribution amount to have it take effect for the next pay period?
6. Can employees future date contribution % changes?
7. Are contributions only % or can employees specify an amount?
8. Option to exclude bonuses from contributions?
9. Are there automatic cutoffs for hitting the federal limit? Does this accout for employees over the age of 50?
10. What if employee joins midyear and has contributions from other provider? Can the employee indicate their previous contributions for the year for an automatic cutoff?
11. Are Roth contributions available?
12. Are after-tax contributions available?
13. Are in service distributions available, specifically to an employee's roth IRA at another broker?
14. What about in plan conversions from after-tax to Roth 401k? If so can they be automatic?
15. Is a company match catchup at end of the year available if an employee hits the federal max before year end?
16. If an employee leaves the company are they required to close out their account? If not, are there account maintenance fees for former employees? If they do close, is there a fee to do so?
17. Do you have in-kind transfers out for former employees who are closing their account?
18. Do you accept in-kind transfers in for new employees rolling in existing 401ks?
19. Do you support employees borrowing from their 401k?
20. When retirement hits, what are the payout options? Lump sum, monthly paycheck, blended?
21. What financial consulting is available to employees? Are advisors fiduciaries?
22. What kind of customer support is there for employees? Do all questions need to be routed through our HR or can they reach out directly?
23. Do you have 2 factor authentication? If so, what kind? SMS/Email only or also support authenticator apps?
24. Do you host an annual meeting for our employees to go over the plan and options and help them with any questions?",1671548873.0

1. Sell the shares/RSUs at a loss (or atleast a significant percentage, e.g. 15%) and rebalance it across a basket of other stocks. As I understand RSU taxation, I have sold RSUs to make up for the tax liability when granted, so that's effectively my purchase price and hence the difference between the sale price now would be the loss. The disadvantage of this is that I am losing out on the potential gain and don't really have that much significant gains to offset the losses against come tax time

Also, war in Ukraine has exposed Europe’s industrial sector as heavenly dependent on Russian natural gas, driving up energy prices on the continent this year. However, Bayer is less sensitive to gas prices than BASF, for example. Any thought?

3 Retail Defensive Stocks To Consider,0,zqolkb,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zqolkb/3_retail_defensive_stocks_to_consider/,2,"With the pre-announcement of a recession coming in 2023, investors are now looking for stocks that can withstand any market crash, and a weaker economy. One of the best places to be right now is defensive stocks, that can maintain revenues and earnings despite a downturn.

Both grocery retailers and wholesalers seem like a great sector to be in. Afterall people still have to eat even during a recession. Consumers may not spend as much, and to a certain point these stocks can even benefit from a weaker consumer spending.

FMX definitely seems like an option to consider, and it should continue to perform well. Its dividend history also shows a lot of promising returns to shareholders.

ASAI is another interesting Brazilian wholesaler that has impressive operating metrics, and growth, but will the newly elected socialist government have an impact on the value of the real? How can this impact the investment thesis?

Lastly Dino seems like a great stock, but I am unsure whether or not investing in Poland sounds like a great option. Does anyone have any experience with Polish stocks? Could the proximity to Ukraine be a risk to consider, and how well will the zloty hold against other currencies, considering that Poland has one of the [highest inflation rates in Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/15131946/2-19102022-AP-EN.pdf/92861d37-0275-8970-a0c1-89526c25f392)?

I'm looking for advice on everything I could max out before the year is over.

These past few years have been very generous to me and my wife, she makes 100k per year, and my business made 280k last and 175k this year, on top of my salary of 32k. Needless to say, we are doing very well. We had 2 kids in the last few years, and I am just beginning my investments for my family.

What we did last year;

Wife-- maxed 401k, maxed roth ira

Me --maxed Roth ira, (I don't qualify for a personal 401k, and my business is too small to get a company 401k fund)

Kids- 1 10k in kids emsp(states education fund)(529 plan)

I also bought 30k in EE series bonds, one for each of us.


This year;

Wife maxed 401k, maxed Roth ira

Me --maxed Roth ira

Kids 2(now) both maxed 10k each in Mesp

I haven't purchased any EE bonds yet, I keep hearing about T-bonds. Isn't that the same thing?

Also, I realized the 529 plans are basically high-risk ETFs, based on which year your kid is supposed to graduate. So of course it's picking aggressively and right now in this bear market, it's hurting. Im not sure if I will do this next year I might as well open a kid's account and invest in stocks and ETFs.

I guess my question is, do I just buy 40k in EE series bonds before the year is over? (Family of 4 now)",1671484630.0

Monte Carlo Simulation of net worth in Python...,57,zpkrf9,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zpkrf9/monte_carlo_simulation_of_net_worth_in_python/,49,"I'll start by saying I'm not a Python expert - just a dabbler so there is probably a far better way to do this...

**Background**

I'm 100% in equities at the moment, but approaching that final 1/3 of my investing life. I've started to think about my 'transition to bonds' plan and what this might mean for my retirement FIRE number so I built a python app that uses Monte Carlo simulation to model my portfolio.

I've taken historic performance data for the S&P500, Treasury & Corporate Bonds, and inflation since 1929 and found the distribution of this data in terms of average and standard deviation. I''ve then created weight growths for 100% equities, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 etc. I've used all of this data to run 500,000 sims of my lifetime for each of these allocations. I get some simple stats and a distribution curve of my balance for each of the simulations. I understand this US centric view might not give a 100% accurate picture, but given the US is \~70% of the global market it's a fair guess to say that over time what ever the US market does the world is likely to follow.

Anyway I wanted to share the code for review, feedback, or just to use yourself in your own models.

Bayer AG (BAYRY) Due Diligence,106,zpc7vd,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zpc7vd/bayer_ag_bayry_due_diligence/,47,"Fellow redditors,

I like looking at blue chip companies in trouble and presented TEVA on this subreddit ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rhq6n2/teva_pharmaceuticals_due_diligence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zl7cu0/teva_pharmaceuticals_update/)). In my last post I mentioned that Bayer (BAYRY) has some similarities and there were some requests for insights into the company. Both companies are well known and respected in the pharmaceutical sector (my professional field) and overpaid for acquisitions that gained them a lot of debt and lawsuits.

Bayer acquired Monsanto in 2018 for about 63 Billion USD and currently has a market cap of around 50B USD (less than half that of 2017). The company is made up of a crop science and a pharmaceutical arm, with some calling for the two to be split. While lawsuits are routine in both sectors and can get very ugly, the ones around glyphosate had gained an almost political level due to the cumulative hate directed at Monsanto. Monsanto was known to be cynically „ultracapitalist“ in their dealings and became a lightning rod of sorts. The takeover by Bayer with its de-facto rebranding did little to mitigate this. Fittingly enough, selling Monsanto was the cherry on the cake of cynical dealings.

Since tables are messy to present in a post, I prefer just linking the sources this time: [Q3/2022](https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/2022-11/bayer-quarterly-statement-q3-2022.pdf) Report, [2021](https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/2022-03/Bayer-Annual-Report-2021.pdf) Report, [2020](https://www.bayer.com/sites/default/files/2021-02/Bayer-Annual-Report-2020.pdf) Report.

The acquisition did gain Bayer a ""complete"" cropsciences portfolio and some synergies, but the bad overshadowed the good. Net Debt went from 3.6 B EUR in 2017 to about 36 B EUR currently. Sales did rise from mid-30 to mid-40 B EUR, but the -13B EUR from „Litigations/Legal Risks“ in 2020 needs digesting. Bayer did not stop paying dividends, but is reasonably quite conservative in the amounts paid out (about a third of core earnings per share, 2.0 EUR for 2021).

Overall I do not think that Bayer leadership handled the acquisition fallout particularly well, showing little dynamism. However, its current market capitalization is close to the bare bones. With continuing strong sales in two essential businesses, any value investor should pay attention. Debt management will need some consideration and many will steer clear for as long as lawsuits make headlines. That being said, Bayer represent the biggest allocation for individual stocks in my portfolio, so I’m personally quite confident in its future.

Again, I wish you happy holidays and good luck with your investments!",1671407738.0

Are All of the World’s Top Investors Just Doing the Same Exact Thing? Capital Efficient Investing/Return Stacking,64,zoma01,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zoma01/are_all_of_the_worlds_top_investors_just_doing/,8,"So I was reading this AQR piece [(link)](https://images.aqr.com/-/media/AQR/Documents/Journal-Articles/JOI_Feb19_SuperstarInvestors---Brooks_Tsuji_Villalon.pdf) about some of history’s greatest investors (Buffet, Bill Gross, George Soros and Peter Lynch for those curious). As always with AQR, the punchline is that factor exposure solves everything. 

However, I noticed a few things the authors didn’t mention. 

1. For managers who pursued factor exposure within their own asset class (ie an equity manager taking equity factor risk), factor loadings were usually much higher than those of long only factor mutual funds/ETFs (ie Blackrock, DFA or AQR’s funds) and more resembled those of market neutral products (ie QMNRX), but with a beta overlay.

2. Many managers pursued factors/alternative betas **outside** of their own asset class, like Peter Lynch’s bond risk exposure, Soros’s exposure to trend and macro strategies and Gross’s exposure to options selling strategies. Replicating these exposures would call for running a portfolio with gross exposure >100%.

In simpler terms, they’re always stacking the returns of alternative betas onto traditional asset classes.

Conceptually, it seems like other investors do this too. Buffet obviously took a lot of factor risk, but he also had exposure to bond risk, the variance risk premium, FX carry through his borrowing in Yen and Euros, reinsurance, etc. Hedge funds do something similar in a way. Think of a multi manager fund with some pods that pursue true alpha strategies and others (or a center book) that effectively stack risk premia (merger, convertible arb, trend) over those returns.

I realize I’m not reinventing the wheel here. Most traditional stock/bond portfolios have relatively low Sharpe ratios, so adding uncorrelated alts with even very modest Sharpe ratios tends to improve risk adjusted returns. And levering up portfolios with high risk adjusted returns is obviously a good idea. But conceptually, it seems like everyone is doing this in one way or another. Is this really how the best investors outperform? 

If so, this kind of structural alpha seems a lot more dependable than pure stock picking skill. And for investors with high risk tolerances, it would make a lot more sense to pursue something like a Soros-esque strategy for example (ie large cap momentum stocks with a 15 vol trend overlay) vs EM, microcaps or other similarly risky LO strategies.
Easy to see how the former could outperform the market by 6-7% a year whereas that would be pretty tough for a single segment of the market.

Obviously, I know what went wrong the last time people tried this (portable alpha), but that was often a story of gated hedge funds not allowing clients to redeem capital needed to cover margin calls on their beta overlays. If one manager was doing this, it wouldn’t be a problem.",1671326488.0

I'm looking for more companies which specifically mention these metrics, because any investor can calculate them for any company, but if management is cognizant of those metrics it generally implies that the company is run for the benefit of shareholders. So what are some companies that mention these metrics, whether in conf calls or press releases? I'll offer a few:

FCF/sh - TXN talks about it consistently (multiple times per conference call) and they've basically repurchased half their float over the last 15-20yrs. Margins are insane, dividend is high yet is not a function of a low/falling share price, as they've just had so much FCF that they can redistribute a substantial amount for dividends. 

ROIC - TGT is one, stock has had a rough year but it's not anything wildly out of line with the retail sector. When compared to other retailers they're certainly one of the higher quality companies. 

POOL also mentions ROIC and has also had a rough year but they remain a high quality company, albeit with a rough year ahead of it.

The yield curve inverted mid 2000 & early 2007. The market bottomed out mid 2003 & early 2009. So the last two times, it wasn't ""priced in.""

You can see a longer version of this chart here.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=1137676

When the green line is negative, the yield is inverted, and when the blue/green lines are negative, the stock market dropped year over year.

**Whats the yield curve?**
It shows treasury rates of various durations. Normally longer terms give higher yields and the curve slopes uphill. Inverted yield curves slope slightly downhill and typically predict a recession in the USA. 

**Why does an inverted yield curve typically predict a recession in the USA?**
The Fed increases the short term rates until the market predicts a recession, at which point everyone wants to hold long term treasuries, because the Fed will drop rates into a recession, and if long term rates also drop, then long term treasuries are a fantastic hedge.

Because of its secure ability to generate income, the capital appreciation is also almost guaranteed.

How does a stock's performance in a secondary market affect the company??,5,zon8qz,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zon8qz/how_does_a_stocks_performance_in_a_secondary/,16,"Learning about how stocks work here so please bear with me. From what I learned so far, I know that stocks are a way of basically fundraising a lot of capital that they can use to fund business operations to grow and become more profitable. And this is why many companies will opt to go public instead of solely running on private VC backing.

But what about after all the outstanding shares are bought up and the stock begins trading on a secondary market such as the NYSE/NASDAQ exchanges? How does this activity affect the company and its business performance?  
Now I'm specifically asking about how the performance of the stock's price in a secondary market affects the company, if at all, and not the other way around of how the company's performance affects the stock price.  
I know that in terms of how a company affects its stock price, it's mainly driven by supply and demand, and on a deeper level that supply and demand are impacted greatly by large institutional investors and analysts that analyze the fundamentals of a company to determine its intrinsic value vs. its market value to see if its price is a justified one.

But what about in the cases where a stock's price drastically changes maybe due to market manipulation and hype, which has little to nothing to do with a company's performance? Such as Gamestop? I knew it blew up like crazy due to the hype, but how did that affect the company and its operations? I imagine that it did nothing to the company right? Because after all the stocks of a company get bought up, that's it, they achieved their fundraising objective, and however those shares are resold in a secondary market exchange is the individual investor's business, unless it does something like issue out more stocks, right?  
So I'm assuming that in the case of, Gamestop, that crazy stock performance did nothing for the company in general and their business operations continued as normal, and it merely left the company a hot topic to talk about among the media, investors, and the board of directors.

Sorry if my line of questioning is a bit scattered, it's just how I'm trying to organize my thoughts and confusion while typing this out. But hopefully, my understanding is somewhat correct and my questions make sense haha. Thanks in advance.",1671329367.0

Opinions on borrowing money to invest in the stock market?,0,zp6j3r,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zp6j3r/opinions_on_borrowing_money_to_invest_in_the/,39," 

I've heard in the past that it's not smart to borrow money or take out a loan and invest it into the Stock Market.

In the past I would take out $10,000-$20,000 loans that ran for \~5 years at an interest rate anywhere from 7%-9%.

Yes I know that ultimately I shouldn't be doing that. Fortunately I got really lucky and placed them into very good blue chip companies before deciding to just withdraw it all and then just dump everything into an S&P500 index fund.

There is another interesting thing about this strategy that I wanted to point out. That even though the interest rates were high at 7%-9%, and the loans were for about 5 years, I would pay them all off within less than a year like anywhere from 6months-8months. So I didn't have to pay much interest on the loan due to paying it off so quickly. My goal was to simply take a large lump sum and quickly put it all into the market. Basically ""time in the market"" >>> all else. It would have taken me considerably longer to wait to accumulate $20,000 with my bi-weekly pay checks.

For future reference I don't plan to do this anymore, but I would like to hear people's thoughts on this?",1671392690.0

After 1 year, the stock is called away and I get the remaining cash.

Then I net gained like $11.5 per stock and it’s a long term gain instead of a short term gain and is then taxed slightly less. Plus I only need to worry about paying the tax the next year (so about 2 years from now!) when taxes are filed.

Of course I can lose more if the stock run more. But if I don’t expect the stock to run, or I’m perfectly ok with giving up more gains, this seems to be a reasonable tactic to ‘sell but don’t pay taxes now’?

Edit: solved. It depends on how long you have been holding the stock before writing the CC. The holding period gets suspended when you write CC against it. When your shares gets called away, you are taxed on (premium + strike) - cost basis. 

So if you hold the stock for 1month and then write CC. Then no matter how long the CC is, your taxes are short term. If you hold the stock for 1year+ then write CC, that gain will be long term.",1671235687.0

* The Fed has two responsibilities: inflation, and employment.  NOT ""The Markets"".
* Conventional Wisdom: Interest rate adjustments generally take 6-12 months to have their impact.
 * Thus (1) the rate-related effects we see today are the result of last summer's changes, 
 * And (2) this week's easing-off will be felt next spring, not next week.
* MoM inflation IS coming down.  Slowly -- but that's the goal, right? Soft landing?
 * YoY inflation still includes several months of -high- inflation, which are still being counted.
* AND, employment seems to be pretty darn resilient / resistant to this tightening.  That's a good thing -- there are still more job openings than people looking for them.

My thesis is that all  these assumptions are overly optimistic due to inflation becoming  entrenched in labor, housing, excess money supply, and supply chain  issues. Also, that as a results rates will have to go higher and remain  elevated for a longer period (through 2023, so no rate cuts), and that  we are facing a moderate to severe recession in 2023 (no soft landing).  Granted, only one of these assumptions would have to break to adversely  affect the market. My sources include historical data on inflation  trends, earnings forecasts for 2023, the recent inflation report, and  the track record of the Fed. As a result, I'm jumping on the 3200 S&P bandwagon for 2023, looking forward to buying opportunities.

Eight men who used social media platforms to promote stocks they owned were charged by federal prosecutors with engaging in a $144 million “pump and dump” scheme.

Edward Constantinescu, known on Twitter as “@MrZackMorris,” and Perry Matlock, whose Twitter handle is “@PJ\_Matlock,” were among the defendants charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Houston.

Constantinescu and Matlock are co-founders of Atlas Trading, a stock-trading forum on the Discord social media platform. Constantinescu has more than 550,000 Twitter followers, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the eight men yesterday. Matlock has 340,000.

The shares they hyped were in little-known companies including [GTT Communications Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GTTNQ:US), [Surface Oncology Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SURF:US) and [Universe Pharmaceuticals Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UPC:US), according to the indictment.

Also charged were Thomas Cooperman (“Tommy Coops”) Gary Deel (“Mystic Mac”), Mitchell Hennessey (“Hugh Henne”) Stefan Hrvatin (“LadeBackk”), Daniel Knight (“Deity of Dips”) and John Rybarczyk (“Ultra Calls, “The Stock Sniper”).

The case is US v. Constantinescu, 22-cr-00612, US District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).",1671053211.0

As of 14 December 22 (most recent data from Morningstar), VXUS is down 14.05% YTD

VXUS data here https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/vxus/performance

VTI data here https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/performance

when people (including me) post those charts of international vs. us performance, we need to remember how outperformance doesn't necessarily mean you make a lot of money. sometimes outperformance means you lose less money. in 2002, the MSCI ACWI lost 19.32%, but it still managed to outperform the S&P 500 which lost 22.10% https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/docs/sp0/171/AnnualReturnsOfKeyIndices_LazardInvestmentFacts_2013.pdf

* Raised the benchmark policy rate by 50 bps to 4.25-4.50%

* Raised the 2023 terminal rate to 5.00-5.25% from 4.50-4.75% prior

* Raised expected 2023 unemployment rate to 4.6% from 4.4% prior

* Raised expected 2023 inflation (core PCE) to 3.5% from 3.1% prior

* Lowered 2023 GDP growth to 0.50% from 1.2% prior

> Note that the Fed has raised the terminal rate every chance they got this year and the current dot plot is supportive of further increases in 2023. In addition, they see ongoing rate hike increases as appropriate, but could see a stepdown to 25bps in future meetings. The Fed also reiterated their higher for longer stance.

**From the 2:30 PM EST Q&A session (highlight points):**

* Reiterated countless times over and over that history has set a precedent in which financial conditions being loosened too soon has resulted in resurging inflation. Higher for longer was brought up many many times.

* Economic pain cannot be avoided in the path to restoring price stability. The costs of not restoring price stability will far outweigh any near term economic pain. 

* Expressed extremely clearly that they are devoted to the goal of a sustainable 2% inflation. Absolutely no consideration on 3% or 4%. 

* Current projections do not see any rate cuts in 2023. 

* The biggest problem in tacking inflation is services/labor. Services/labor remain too tight, are less sensitive to interest rate changes, and make up over 50% of inflation statistics. 

* Path to soft landing continues to narrow, but will not discuss 'hypotheticals' such as stagflation. Hesitant to address a soft landing question and answers regarding a soft landing were much weaker than in previous sessions.

* Happy to see weak inflation prints over the last two months, but will need to see significantly more definitive proof that inflation on its way lower to a sustainable 2%.

Latest in the FTX saga - The Parents in the Middle of FTX’s Collapse - NYT,667,zl89wy,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zl89wy/latest_in_the_ftx_saga_the_parents_in_the_middle/,190,"Not sure if this really conforms to the guidelines, but it is about an investment firm gone belly up and maybe is a cautionary tale. Anyway ...

That both Blankman-Fried's parents are Stanford University law professors has been a sorry part of this story, as had they known, they surely would have strenuously objected, right?. They weren't estranged, apparently, so it's too bad he didn't make them privy to his accounting books

But there is a $16.4 million house in the Bahamas in his parents' name, where they have stayed when they visit, that could become a big deal in this case for them. They all insist the house was intended to be a company property, not theirs and that they never thought of it as theirs. Yet, there it is, in their name. I'm sure that will get looked at.

His father visited the Bahamas at least monthly, according to reporting from the NYT. You have to wonder how this remained hidden.

And what about the CFO and the general counsel? His general counsel used to work with Gary Gensler and is no light weight. How could you not wonder about the books? Did he? Didn't he wonder where the money came from for Alameda? How can he be a general counsel at FTX and not catch a clue of what the bankruptcy court saw in literally five minutes -- literally no books in any sense of the word? I'm going to guess this was the least busy general counsel in corporate history - never got a phone call , never got a question, never attended a meeting?

According to other reporting, (on Yahoo) his parents have been with him in the Bahamas for the last month, and the Times says:

""Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried are part of a small group offering Mr. Bankman-Fried legal advice, according to a person familiar with the matter. The couple has also turned to the Stanford faculty for support: David Mills, a criminal law professor at Stanford and a close family friend, is part of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s legal team. Mr. Bankman has his own lawyer, the former federal prosecutor [Ronald G. White](https://wmhlaw.com/2022/10/11/ronald-g-white-joins-wmh-as-partner-in-white-collar-defense-and-investigations-practice/). ""

Have to believe he hasn't been following their advice, right? They can't have advised him to get out there and talk nonstop for a month (?)

EDIT- 
Holy cow, this is getting really intriguing. I haven’t delved into this that deeply so I guess I am missing a lot. I apologize for the paywall. This story from November says that FTX bought a Washington State bank, called Farmington State Bank, one of the smallest banks in the country. 



From the article: 

“It’s unclear how FTX was allowed to buy a stake in a U.S.-licensed bank, which would need to be approved by federal regulators. Banking veterans say it’s hard to believe that regulators would have knowingly allowed FTX to gain control of a U.S. bank.

“The fact that an offshore hedge fund that was basically a crypto firm was buying a stake in a tiny bank for multiples of its stated book value should have raised massive red flags for the F.D.I.C., state regulators and the Federal Reserve,” said Camden Fine, a bank industry consultant who used to head the Independent Community Bankers of America. “It’s just astonishing that all of this got approved.”

When to go back in the market?,0,zmrd6l,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zmrd6l/when_to_go_back_in_the_market/,51,"Hi guys, not sure why I did it but I sold all my stocks back in February and I'm all in cash since then. I'm starting to think how I should get back in the market and the answer surely depends on when the fed pivot will occur.

From what I've read, the market is forecasting a fed rates peak in may and then a decrease in the second semester.

So the idea would be to buy ETFs with 25% of my cash reserve every quarter of 2023. I would aim for the bloodiest days by monitoring the RSI or something similar. 

There is no specific reason why I think that the bottom will occur somewhere in 2023 but when I compare to 2008 or the dot com crash, 2 years is something I believe as a long period for a crash.

For info, my portfolio is composed of 5 etf from which the s&p, eurostoxx etc etc

These forces coupled with the US markets' absolute dominance over the last decade might have led you to concentrate your assets there. And it would be easy to assume with the seemingly bigger problems in Europe, for example, that the US would still be well ahead of most other countries. 

However, things are beginning to shift - you can decide for yourself if the below is a trend or mirage, but the US vs. non-US dynamic in the global stock market is worth paying attention to more so than the mainstream financial media is. 

Over the last year, through 12/14/2022 per Morningstar (total returns):

The S&P 500 is down 12.38%

The NASDAQ is down 26.09%

The Dow is down 3.04% (the Dow is a garbage index but it's still quoted everywhere so I won't omit). 

&#x200B;

Now compare that to some notable international indices and other country returns over the last year (single country returns based on MSCI country index):

MSCI EAFE: -8.51%

MSCI ACWI ex USA: -11.24% (this means the global investable stock market excluding the US has beaten the US market over the last year now)

United Kingdom: +3.17%

Italy: -8.58%

France: -5.94%

Germany: -16.94%

Japan: -14.36%

China: -22.49%

Australia: +1.47%

Stock Market - Economy Discussion,0,zmaf5o,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zmaf5o/stock_market_economy_discussion/,6,"Don’t have anyone to personally discuss this with so to Reddit I go…

My understanding is that even earnings contraction to a historically semi-normal level ($200 per share for SP500) at a 17x PE would only bring us slightly below the lows of this year.   Would be a drop from where we are, but not crippling.  Any form of recession would also possibly push the Fed closer to a pause, then pivot?  The “higher for longer” rhetoric from Jerome Powell seems to signal that they’re willing to allow a bit of pain, but at this point who believes the Fed?  What are the odds a “financial accident” occurs and really hits the economy?  Which brings me to my next point..

In a deeper recession, could we see a bit more PE contraction (say 15-16x) and SP500 EPS drop to $175?  What evidence is there for a deep recession vs. a mild recession?  Household debt levels, layoffs, past due mortgage rates, etc?  Which area seems like the last straw?  We had the BoE and UK Pension event a bit ago, Credit Suisse still seeming to raise red flags (both overseas)… What could be the “thing” that buckles the US economy and sends us into a deeper recession than most currently expect?

I ask this because when disinflation signals are ringing, markets shot up as we’ve seen today.

However, this got me thinking.

Could this be counter intuitive?

When your portfolio goes from 75k to 100k, if it the gains are unrealized you “feel” richer.

This leads to more spending, more spending = more demand, more demand = upwards pressure on prices.

This causes rates to go up even higher than necessary.

Is this a negative feedback loop that’s being factored in right now or no?

Teva Pharmaceuticals update,50,zl7cu0,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zl7cu0/teva_pharmaceuticals_update/,6,"Dear fellow Redditors,

A year ago I posted ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rhq6n2/teva_pharmaceuticals_due_diligence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) a DD on Teva pharmaceuticals and I wanted to provide a short yearly update as well as mention another company that is similarly positioned.

Teva (market cap of 10.07 B \[9.27 B last year\]) is currently still battling the quite damaging purchase of Allergan Generics in 2015 \[40.5 B\] which brought the company a lot of debt and lawsuits related to opioid sales, both of which Teva is now slowly digesting.

TEVA has a current debt of 21.3 B (in Q3/22: 18.5B long term, 2.8B short term \[23.7B in Q3/21\]). The company is not paying dividends and focusing on reducing debt to the tune of about 2B/year, which it was quite consistent in doing during Kare Schultz’s tenure as CEO. Kare will be handing over the reins to Richard Francis in 2023 (former head of Sandoz, the generic branch of Novartis). With opioid litigation seemingly settled and restructuring well underway, Richard is likely to have less headwind starting into the job.

The stock price jumped to a market cap of 12.45B in Aug22 after opioid settlement plans were disclosed, but has come back down since, likely due to concerns with rising interest rates and leadership handover. I sold half of my stocks in summer (could not resist the windfall) and have started buying again more recently. Overall I think Teva did a good job in correcting course and continues to be a solid long value investment.

If like me you have a penchant for blue-chip companies restructuring after disastrous acquisitions, Bayer (BAYRY) bears uncanny similarities to Teva. Bayer \[current Market Cap 54B\] overpaid for Monsanto in 2018 \[63 B\] and gained a string of lawsuits bolstered by bad press. Recently I was discussing with a lawyer specialized in mergers and acquisitions how embarassingly bad the DD must have been in both cases (or how well the involved consultants sold the deal). I’ve been following Bayer for some time and might post a more in depth look if anybody is interested.

>The bottom line: Powell saying that Fed will consider cutting rates when the Fed is confident that inflation is “moving towards 2%” is like saying, “Forget everything I said about staying the course. Forget about ‘higher for longer.’ We’re turning the money printer back on sooner than you think.”

Article makes the point that high YoY inflation comparisons will likely take us to lower CPI readings, and consequently give Powell room to cut rates.

Scientists estimate that by all current projections we’re going to top out at just around 20% more people in total, about [10 billion.](https://www.livescience.com/16493-people-planet-earth-support.html)

That’s pittance compared to the 2 billion to 8 billion jump that we’ve seen in 70 years, and also suggests a vast slowing of all growth, across all sectors, permanently.

With people like Elon “coincidentally” tweeting about birth rates at the same time TSLA is crashing, are they seeing what we should already know? The growth paradigm wasn’t so much capitalism and innovation as it was just more and more people being born at a crazy rate.

Without that rate of birth and with many of those first wave peaking out their wealth potential, the only other growth market I see is bringing literally the rest of the developed world into a first-world consumerist lifestyle, hopefully manufactured by automation at that point.

Should we include settlement lag in calculating Treasury Bill interest rate?,5,zkhk9t,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zkhk9t/should_we_include_settlement_lag_in_calculating/,18,"I've been buying new auction T-Bills recently and I noticed one issue that may make them look more attractive than they really are. This is less of an issue for T-Bills with longer maturities like 6 or 12 months, but for the shorter ones like 4 weeks it may be especially noticeable.

The issue is the lag between the auction date and the settlement date. Let's take the most recent 4 week T-Bill auction as an example. The lag between the auction date and the settlement date is 5 days (I'm using calendar days instead of business days, for reasons that will become obvious later). The maturity of the T-Bill is 28 days, which does not include the 5 day lag. The auction price was $99.7161. To calculate the yield we just apply the formula:

(100 - 99.7161) / 99.7161 \* (365 / 28) = 3.711%

Which matches what the Treasury website shows as the investment yield for that auction. However, note that the use of the 28 days in the formula. One problem with this calculation is that our money, when participating in this auction, is not merely tied up for 28 days. The money is deducted on the auction date and released on the maturity date. So in reality the money is tied up for 33 days. So in reality, based on when our money is actually going into this investment, the rate should be calculated as follows:

(100 - 99.7161) / 99.7161 \* (365 / 33) = 3.149%

This is a quite a bit lower than what the rate looks like when you ignore the settlement lag! Of course for longer durations this is less of an issue, it is especially acute when buying the 4 week T-Bill.

Has anybody else given this some thought? I wonder if it makes more sense to always take into account the settlement lag when calculating T-Bill yields to make sure comparisons to other assets are fair.",1670893040.0

Fed Rate Increases Are Squeezing Consumer-Finance Companies,491,zj6pfk,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zj6pfk/fed_rate_increases_are_squeezing_consumerfinance/,94,"Companies offer fewer auto loans, mortgages and buy-now-pay-later programs

https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-rate-increases-are-squeezing-consumer-finance-companies-11670712247?mod=hp_lead_pos3

Consumer spending in the U.S. is going strong. Consumer lending, not so much.

The financial squeeze that started about six months ago for companies that lend to ordinary Americans is getting worse, contrasting sharply with recent rallies in stocks and corporate bonds. The main reason: ***These finance companies have lost access to easy money.***

Widespread economic uncertainty has made debt investors less willing to buy the bonds these nontraditional lenders issue. Higher interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, have given investors other attractive options.

Now, ***these finance companies are paying as much as four times what they paid in January to borrow in bond markets the cash they lend to customers.*** Plenty of them are struggling to make that math work. Once-highflying consumer-finance companies such as Pagaya Technologies have flipped from profit to loss. Some smaller outfits are shutting down altogether.

***Many of the nontraditional lenders launched within the past decade, which means they have never weathered a sustained period of high interest rates.***

***“All of these fintech firms talk about their data science and machine learning capabilities, but the truth is, their models have not been battle tested through a recession yet,”*** said Reggie Smith, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s lead fintech stock analyst.

Pagaya and other startups such as Affirm Holdings Inc. and Carvana Co. aren’t banks, which means they can’t take deposits for funding. For borrowers with imperfect credit, these alternative lenders are sometimes the only way to get an auto loan, mortgage or buy-now-pay-later offer.

The companies are now lending less or charging more for loans they do make, adding to concerns already swirling about the health of the economy.

Athas Capital Group, an alternative mortgage lender in Calabasas Hills, Calif., announced its closure in November, citing the poor outlook for selling its loans to Wall Street firms.

“Do I set a bunch of cash on fire to stick around or do I close shop?” asked Brian O’Shaughnessy, co-chief executive officer. “We chose, right or wrong, to close up shop.”

He is now trying to help his roughly 265 employees find jobs at competing firms.

The average price of bonds backed by private-label mortgages recently fell to about 82 cents on the dollar, their lowest level since at least 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Bond prices typically fall when interest rates rise and investors demand higher yields to lend money.

Sales of the bonds made from private-label mortgages, which don’t benefit from federal guarantees, boomed last year when Treasury bonds were paying peanuts.

Normally, loans from alternative lenders are bundled into securities that Wall Street firms sell to pension funds, insurers and other investors. These bonds are known as asset-backed securities, or ABS, and they are typically sold to investors in multiple slices that have different yields based on their risk.

The securitization process is integral to keeping many consumer-finance companies in business, but it can amplify market gyrations in unexpected ways. Prices of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs—a type of ABS—gapped below fair value in October when U.K. insurers and pensions responded to rising interest rates by dumping CLO bonds.

Some investors have stopped buying ABS, which they still associate with the 2008 financial crisis, to reduce risk. Others are selling out of fear that the loans backing the bonds might go bad. Home prices are already falling in many U.S. cities, and delinquencies are creeping up on auto and other consumer loans.

The biggest change, though, is that insurance companies and pension funds have scaled back their interest in ABS, said Rich Barnett, a partner at investing firm Castlelake LP. Rising interest rates have lifted the yields on corporate bonds and Treasury bonds, making them attractive for the first time in years.

Prudential Financial Inc. has slowed once-brisk purchases of ABS and CLOs in its approximately $400 billion insurance account. Instead, it is snapping up high-rated corporate bonds because their yields have risen, socking them away in preparation for when the Fed starts cutting rates again, chief investment officer Timothy Schmidt said.

Investment-grade corporate bond yields doubled this year to a 13-year high of about 5%, which is close to the roughly 7% return many pensions and insurers shoot for. Another benefit: Corporate bonds have longer terms than most ABS, making them better matches to offset the payout schedules of insurance and pension liabilities.

“We will look back at the assets we’re buying now as pretty attractive,” Mr. Schmidt said. “I don’t think anyone expected rates to move this far this quickly.”

Investors still willing to buy the bonds are making borrowers pay up. Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later company, abandoned plans to issue a $350 million bond in November when investors demanded higher yields than it was willing to pay, people familiar with the matter said. The company also finances loans through bank credit lines and direct sales to investors such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

***Pagaya, a technology-driven consumer finance company, went ahead with a $543 million bond last month but had to pay investors an 8.1% interest rate on its best-quality bonds to get the deal done, according to data from Finsight. That marks a steep increase from the 6.1% rate it got on comparable bonds sold in August and 2% on a deal in January.***

Issuance of consumer-loan ABS declined slightly this year, but Pagaya has nearly doubled bond sales to about $3 billion, according to Finsight. Fees from bond sales account for much of the company’s revenue, according to its financial filings.

At the same time, delinquencies have risen on loans bundled into ABS that Pagaya sold. A bond the company issued in January at 100 cents on the dollar traded in mid-November at around 88 cents, according to data from Empirasign.

Pagaya has been buying loans with tighter underwriting standards this year, and its November bond issuance shows that bond investors trust the company’s artificial-intelligence methodology, its 34-year-old co-founder Gal Krubiner said. The U.S. and Israeli firm uses AI to identify attractive loans that other lenders would turn down, Mr. Krubiner said.

“We saw the uncertainty and volatility coming,” he added.

Pagaya’s stock is trading below $1, down from about $10 three months ago.

***Carvana, an online auto dealer, is facing a cash crunch. Its shares, which soared in the pandemic, have lost 98% of their value this year.*** The company recently hired restructuring advisers.

Asset-backed bonds of companies that go bankrupt typically avoid default, but their prices can fluctuate wildly. A bond backed by auto loans that Carvana issued for 100 cents on the dollar in September 2021 traded around 75 this month, according to data from Empirasign. Part of that decline also reflects the rise in overall interest rates.

For the shrinking pool of investors in the market, the yields have rarely been higher.

Subprime auto lender Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC did a roughly $400 million bond deal in late October. The riskiest chunk of its bonds, which had a double-B rating from some agencies, had a spread of 9 percentage points over going rates.

***No comparable subprime auto bond had ever priced with such a wide spread since at least the last financial crisis, according to John Kerschner, U.S. head of securitized products at Janus Henderson Investors. Investors who bought the debt received a yield of over 13%, according to Finsight.***

“It very much feels like you’re getting paid for the risk right now—and then some, quite frankly,” said Mr. Kerschner, who has been investing broadly in ABS.

I would love to open a dialog with each of them as they get older or are interested in understanding investing about this and help guide their learning.  I also plan to give them very small, token gifts, so that they have something to open on the special days, though I don't really want them to feel like I am leaving them out or being inconsiderate. I am fairly close to them all, though we do not live near each other for regular hanging out. 

How have you or would you handle this situation? ",1670879999.0

The market value of the Fund updates in real-time! Now that is a high bar for transparency!

Last week the Fund announced their plans for 2023-2025 named Strategy 2025.

It covers five areas: Performance, Technology, Operational Robustness, People and Communications.

I have analyzed it and here are the most important points.

• Emphasis on long-term horizons. Volatile markets create opportunities that the Fund wants to exploit.

• Focus on soft aspects of investing. Allowing portfolio managers to be contrarian and avoiding herd behavior.

• Allowing investments in private markets (pre-IPO) to gain access to companies earlier in their life cycle.

• Focus on mandatory corporate sustainability reporting. That will include higher expectations on climate change and human rights.

• Harnessing big data. Strenghtening investment processes by market and non-market data analysis.

• Active management of geopolitical risk. Scenario analysis and stress testing.

to maturity plus I will receive $100 on 01/31/2024 which is equal to a total of $102.625 for an investment of $95.86. which is a profit of $6.765 and on an investment of $95.86 that is pretty good return of 7.05%.

We have spent 1 year on the project and spent 6 months in country. We received Govt approval, sourced land, permits done, connections made etc. So all of the ground work has been done.

We found an investor but he has delayed and delayed.

Now we are not sure where to turn.

Backdoor Roth with an old SEP IRA,6,zh298d,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zh298d/backdoor_roth_with_an_old_sep_ira/,2,"In Q1 2023 I'd like to do a Roth contribution for 2022, but my 2022 household income will likely exceed the Roth limit, so I'll need to do a backdoor Roth.

A few questions!

1. Is it correct that I need to get rid of the SEP IRA before doing the backdoor Roth?

2. Will there be any tax liability for rolling a SEP IRA into a 401k? (Both are pre-tax so I expect not, but just checking.)

3. If the SEP IRA to 401k rollover occurs in Q1 2023, can I still do the traditional IRA deposit and backdoor Roth conversion for the 2022 tax year before tax day? Or does the backdoor Roth need to be for the 2023 tax year at that point?

\-I place a bid to buy 30 bonds at 94.25, @ 5.10% yield -> Order gets cancelled an hour later.

\-Seller then re-lists the bond immediately, increasing the price to 95 @ 4.95% yield (why?)

Your thoughts on Financial Advisors actively managing your Portfolio?

That is a pretty significant cost ratio, especially in a tanking market where they still get paid even if they don't make you money for the year. As a self-pitch, they often mention that ""on Average we make 3% more than a self-managed account"", but what is that data compared against? Someone who keeps their entire portfolio in a Bank of America savings account?

To simplify this question and discussion, I guess I want to ask people here a few specific questions:

* If you worked with someone managing your money, what were they able to earn you YoY? (Most interested in the ""Safe Time Horizon"" pool of money, rather than wild shit they are willing to be more risky on.
* How do you feel about still paying someone to manage your money when the market is shit like this?

One of the FA's I asked how much money I would have to give them to manage to get a specific yearly salary target of passive income, and their response implied they can earn me 6% YoY pretty safely. This seems insane, right? 6% YoY is what FTX was trying to crypto scheme people into believing for ""staking"" before they collapsed.

Right now, with Bonds you basically have a free 4.75% investment you can make every few months or so, and I just can't imagine anyone doing anything else ""safely"" that makes much more than that?",1670614268.0

Meanwhile, only one of my investments have a higher yield (Verizon), thirteen of my stocks yield less than 3%, and everything else falls between 3% and the current CDs rate. 

But, here's where it gets complicated! From a purely yield perspective, I should dump my entire portfolio and buy CDs. Of course, stocks don't just pay dividends, they also appreciate (or depreciate) over time. So, are their well-known strategies for balancing this? I can safely assume that John Deere and Dupont are going to continue to paying a dividend much lower than what CDs are paying.

I figured that there is a finite supply of money getting used by a finite number of people and while I know not every age has a demand for money, across the board, the averages may even out. I took the M2 supply over the Total Population and then took the year over year growth rates.

From roughly 1960 through end of 2019 there was a specific range with a geometric mean of roughly 6% growth of M2. However, the COVID-19 pandemic skyrocketed the growth rate above what would be considered normal, as seen by the large spike at the far right of the chart.

Assuming the most safe thing to do is investing in bonds or whatever relatively safe investment in papers in the financial market, what are the chances it is possible for one to leave poverty trying it?

I am aware that it is hard to borrow money from banks when one is poor, but if one presents a convincing investment plan would banks refuse it?

Anyway, it is just for brainstorm and curiosity. I don't expect to become rich doing it because if it was that easy everybody would be doing it.

Xmas gift for mom - retirement fund?,144,zf2kzh,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zf2kzh/xmas_gift_for_mom_retirement_fund/,84,"My mom is 51 years old and has little to no savings. She’s been divorced for over 10 years and got little to nothing from the divorce - neither of them had much money or assets to their names at the time. She lives alone in a pretty expensive part of the country (Sonoma) and earns enough for rent and basic expenses through her part time job but not nearly enough to put money aside for savings and her eventual retirement. She is passionate about yoga and personal wellness so she invests most of her time towards studying those subjects and developing a related business. She’s diligently working towards some day having a private practice where she coaches individuals on these subjects, but I fear (and unfortunately predict) that her plan may never come to fruition. With that in mind, my fear is she’ll continue to age without any growing savings or significant source of income.

I’m 31 years old and feel very financially stable. I run a successful business that has allowed me to generate a good steady income and set up a retirement plan that (if all continues well) will guarantee a very comfortable future for my wife and I.

With the holidays approaching I started thinking what a good gift for my mom would be. I wondered if instead of buying her a book or a yoga mat or what have you, I could give her something more valuable, something that would make a significant difference in her life and future. Her financial instability and future uncertainty is something that I know takes a lot out of her and also concerns me on a near daily basis. 

One thought that came to mind is gifting her a retirement plan - setting it up and proposing to contribute to it monthly for the rest of her life (subject to change based on my personal ability to do so). I feel this would be better than giving her cash she would probably spend rather than save or invest. I also feel it wouldn’t strain me much - it would be spread out over time instead of a lump sum, and it would give me peace of mind knowing the money was being set aside for something good (retirement, emergencies) rather than spent on recreation, bad investments, trips, etc.

Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions?

I also have a specific question about the risks associated with these programs. In [this document](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/landing-zones/Fully-Paid-Lending-Program-Investor.pdf), Fidelity says that ""Fidelity is your counterparty on all fully paid lending transactions.""

To me, this suggests that I don't need to worry about any individual short seller defaulting or anything like that, I just need to worry about the broker defaulting. Is that correct? In other words:

I appreciated the few who provided constructive criticism as well although I'm not sure it was a majority.

Edit: I do not intend to live poor and broke my entire life, I will post a yearly update about my situation and financial outlook, I'll try to be more transparent about my gross, and net incomes and provide further breakdowns of my outlook and a generalization of how enjoyable my life has been.
Remindme bot will be in the comments if you would like a reminder.

I want to break down my current position for you and if there's anything I'm missing please ask in the comments.

I'm currently 23, I've saved roughly 35,000 as of now adding all my assets. The past few years I've not saved a ton of money as my jobs didn't pay much, recently I've gotten a job that pays very well compared to any of my past jobs, easily over 60k/year, and will be looking at a 30% raise within the next 5 years as well, on top of this I've applied to a salaried position that may increase my pay even more, if I get the job that is.

Calculations for 2023 limits
Right now my situation is that my employer will match 7% of to my ROTH 401k which depending on how much I make is looking at 5800-8000 contributions from my employer, doing the math on the conservative side leaves me responsible for 323$/week for contributions to meet the limit by EOY. I also save an additional 125$ a week for 2023 ROTH IRA contributions. On top of this I contribute 25$ to my HSA which my employer will match up to 1,000/year of, the HSA is set up to be invested in a growth large cap ETF, as well as my ROTH IRA and 401K in the same growth large cap ETF.

My biggest concern is the excess income I make, a good problem to have I'm sure, but retiring at 40 means I won't preferably be touching my retirement until retirement age, luckily I can still withdraw contributions if I ever need considering it's ROTH. I make around 800-1200$ a week after all deductions, 125$ of this will be going to ROTH IRA. so let's say 675-1075$ left over. I took the average and it was around 1,000, so with all my other bills which I have very few I'm left around 700$/week in free cash flow if you may. I want to put this money to use, as of now I've just been putting the money in an investment account and investing long term, but I spoke to a RFA friend of mine and we got into the situation he suggested Real Estate as a way to leverage myself and diversify, his suggesting was to get an FHA loan on a 1st property, a single family home or duplex, and live there to build equity instead of paying rent, and to invest in a 2nd property as an investment property, and putting the minimum amount down on the FHA property and putting 20% down on the investment property.

I've spent the last year really focusing on my long term financial goals, I'm willing to do whatever this takes, is there any other opinions or any ways I could improve my current outlook? I've spent the past few months learning everything I can about RE investing and focusing on working and saving as much money.  If you took time to read this I appreciate you guys :)",1670446583.0

Earn 16% yields on afrm 12.50 covered calls expiring Dec 30,0,zf92ob,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zf92ob/earn_16_yields_on_afrm_1250_covered_calls/,16,"As of Dec 7, 12:40pm’ish, affirm covered calls exp Dec 30, 2022 are paying 16% yields. If you bought this morning around $11.30 or lower, you are looking at closer to 20%. The stock is currently around $11.52.

My price target for the stock for the next four weeks is a range of 10-14. But I believe the stock will close the year around $14.

I turned very bullish on affrm and Bbpl after watching the YouTube channel Modern MBA further breakdown the business model. [Buy Now Pay Later Business Model explained](https://youtu.be/R1JaMRpcDrQ)


Bull case

-Buy now pay later is not going away. As recent holiday data has shown, consumers are using it more. The long term play here is for Affirm to onboard its members onto its new debt card which will lower their cost of borrowing. THE US ECONOMY IS AND REMAINS STRONG. 

-If afrm starts charging higher interest rates which I believe it has enough pricing power to do, that will greatly improve its finances and margins.

-if affirm starts charging interest rates similar to credit cards, affirm would be profitable within a quarter or two.

-Unlike other bnpl companies, afrm has the most market share of American consumer which are the most profitable in the world.

-I expect a rally to close out 2022 like the last three years.


Bear case

-A 100 basis point interest rate hike will send the market down and afrm stock to sub $10, but probably not lower than $9. 

-A bad and deep recession and mass unemployment. But even so, this data isn’t coming out until Jan or Feb.


My thesis

Fair value for the stock in my opinion is around $12.50 but I can see it ranging between $10-14. It’s also a good proxy for spy and economic data/news. With 16% yields, should be worth the risk. I do recommend hedging a bit. Buy puts outright. If you can stomach volatility, buy a lot of put spreads at the money or 2 strikes below it. Hedging will cut your yield down to 8-10% but you’ll be able to sleep at night with a 20% margin of safety. 


My current position

I got greedy Monday. Entered into the trade for a quick flip but had an issue where TD wasn’t letting me carry out the trade due to funds not clearing until the next day, so I couldn’t buy puts exp end of the month instead of this week. 

-13.5c exp this Friday that I intend to roll 

-Hedged 60% of the position with 13 and 13.5p exp Friday and 13.5p exp Dec 16 I sold earlier. I also have 13/12.50 put spreads exp Dec 16 accounting for 25% of my position.

-My cost basis is around $12.90. Yea, I’m down, 5.26%, but afrm is a momentum stock. The stock will either hit $9 to $15 next week. If it drops, I’ll average down. I do think the Fed will ease up a bit and we only see a 50 point hike. I’m around breakeven since I earned 5% doing the same thing last week.",1670437433.0

And then is that idea based on the idea mutual funds are more often actively managed and those types of funds generally have more capital gains or dividends? Is it due to mutual fund 'rules' where they have to return cash or some sort of accounting quirk how they deal with capital gains?

The Fed is hiking as earnings are falling and people have redefined the word 'pivot' into something nonsensical,167,zdgzav,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zdgzav/the_fed_is_hiking_as_earnings_are_falling_and/,88,"So to start things off here is how the Fed would usually react to weakening economic conditions: 

1.  Economic activity is weakening -> the Fed will ease financial conditions in order to minimize the economic pain

2. The impact of rate cuts are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

3. There is some suffering, but thanks to the Fed, the expected pain was lessened and we are able to return to growth

Now thanks to inflation, here is how things are going:

1. Economic activity is weakening -> the Fed is actively tightening financial conditions in order to cause economic pain in order to manage inflation

2. The impact of rate hikes are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

3. There is considerable suffering as the Fed requires economic activity to contract in order to manage inflation

4. Once inflation is sufficiently tamed, the Fed will cut rates so the economy can return to growth

5. The impact of rate cuts are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

People are assuming that inflation is going to rapidly fall off when we don't even have positive real rates across the entire US yield curve. 

While goods inflation is rapidly abating, the recent nonfarm payrolls and ISM services heavily implies we are seeing the beginning stages of a wage-cost spiral. CPI will fall as goods disinflate, but services will support inflation.

People believe the Fed hiking 50 bps is 'pivoting' and have twisted rate hikes into something that is positive for the markets. 'pivot' is now akin to 'transitory' and the word is now bastardized to death.  

The current economic outlook is bad. Its really bad. Analyst predictions have historically been more optimistic vs reality and this time around they all forecast a downturn. Its more likely than not their current forecasts are too optimistic and that 2023 will end up worse than many expect.

What I was going to suggest was that (being that he’s got to sell something anyway) he should figure out how much is needed to sell, then take that amount of stock and sell covered calls over the year.

OTM at the beginning of a year, progressing to to ITM at the end of the year to ensure they sell if needed.

Revisiting green hydrogen stocks - worth a gamble?,4,zdsnd5,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zdsnd5/revisiting_green_hydrogen_stocks_worth_a_gamble/,17,"Geopolitics, macroeconomics, hydrocarbons and EVs have dominated the news about the energy sector for a while now, so there's been little attention for developments in hydrogen. Expensive hydrocarbons have driven the price of electricity up to a point that profitable green hydrogen production is absolutely impossible. But I think this counterintuitively could set the stage for another hydrogen hype.

First of all; the past years have been quite good to energy giants. Both in hydrocarbons and renewables the skyrocketing prices result in an influx of profits, providing capital for investments. Compared to 18-24 months ago electricity prices are almost 10 times higher in Europe, providing a further incentive to invest. It will be interesting to see how prices develop in 6 months or so.

Those investments won't be online by that time ofc. But they will fill up the order books in the sector - impacting analysis - while at the same time the economy struggles due to ongoing inflation. A somewhat natural reaction would be to overestimate future supply while underestimating future demand. That makes selling futures less attractive, putting further pressure on spot prices, potentially resulting in prolonged periods of negative prices during summer - the perfect environment for green hydrogen production.

I expect/hope this results in a surge in demand for fuel cells, which are impossible to get because even now all the companies producing them have order backlogs for multiple years. It might be a golden ticket towards economies of scale and profitablility for them, something not a single one achieved in the past decade.

Extremely speculative ofc, but what do you think? Are you interested in companies producing hydrogen stacks, and if so which one?

If I look at the FRED data I can see daily data, but only for some arbitrary scaled ""Index"" value, not market cap: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500

It has been on a downtrend for a bit now, and as it is one of our oldest vices I could see there being value there. Plus the continued legalization in both the U.S in Canada will prove to be a constant catalyst. Any input would be helpful.",1670304887.0
"Mission Square Retirement rebranded, then moved my retirement funds to a different index fund with much higher net expenses",3,zdht86,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zdht86/mission_square_retirement_rebranded_then_moved_my/,3,"Not sure which subreddit to ask this, Mission Square rebranded from IMCA-RC, I am unfamiliar with how this went down.

My initial reaction is this BS but wanted to ask some that may know more then me, thank you.",1670270569.0

SARK is listed as a ""daily inverse ETF"" - would this have anything to do with this behavior?

What am missing here? Is it due to the expense ratio of the ETF itself?",1670318926.0

I bought I-bonds back in April of this year.  I checked my account, and I see no interest added.  I understand no interest will show for the first 3 months.  But shouldn't I have seen some interest payments by now?",1670263872.0
"Real Estate, Blackstone, Fundrise?",132,zciphb,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zciphb/real_estate_blackstone_fundrise/,62,"After hearing the recent news about Blackstone $BX, I was wondering how these other popular crowd funded REITs like Fundrise are doing? 

Anybody here invested with Fundrise? Any insight will be great. Are you having trouble liquidating? Is Fundrise at risk of bankruptcy? Are you happy with your investment? What's the benefit compared to regular REITs that can be traded?

Speaking of Blackstone, what do you all think of the recent news of them limiting withdrawals from their BREIT. It current holds $69 billion assets in the REIT and sold off some casino properties to shore up it's cash. 

Anyone here invested in $BX or specifically in their BREITS? Is Blackstone at risk of imploding even though it has limited withdrawals? Will they be liquidating properties? And is the fear of big money snatching up rental properties overblown? Will companies like Blackstone continue to buy up properties in a down market or will be selling like everyone else during a recession?

I have close to 0 knowledge of Fundrise but I suspect Blackstone should be fine due to limiting withdrawals and the amount of money they have. I do worry about the trend of big money buying up all the properties especially if they don't liquidate but instead buy even more when we finally are in the depths of recession.

DADA potentially a good idea with loosening Covid restrictions?,0,zdjnnu,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zdjnnu/dada_potentially_a_good_idea_with_loosening_covid/,4,"Do you guys think DADA, about 52% owned by JD.com, is a good investment right now?

They do on-demand local retail, so it would seem they benefit from holiday shopping and less Covid restrictions, but not sure.

What do you guys think?

They’re up like most other Chinese stocks because of these new loosening restrictions, but considering their long term value too, do you guys think it’s a buy? I have respect for JD.com as a big retailer, so if they own DADA nexus, I think that’s a positive sign for the company’s growth prospects.",1670274309.0
"Relatively Safe Investments to make with $5K, $10K, or even $15K?",0,zdtcwn,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/zdtcwn/relatively_safe_investments_to_make_with_5k_10k/,18,"Hello everyone, new to this subreddit. I was recently invested in Gemini Earn making a relatively stable amount of interest daily that compounded. Since something has happened and their earn program has stopped I withdrew my funds from the program not wanting to risk my money. I want to one day invest into real estate, but I know it isn’t as simple as said and requires much knowledge and have no idea on where to start with that.

In the meantime, what would you all recommend for me to be the best relatively low-risk investment in todays market, as i’m looking for something new I can learn and invest in and don’t think anything like 15K would be enough to get into real estate. Gemini was easy passive income, but since that has been gone I need something else to provide that passive income. At first I was thinking of some other program that can provide compound interest that’s trustworthy but I am not sure of any other program like that except BlockFi which I have not tried out.

Thank you!",1670296235.0
