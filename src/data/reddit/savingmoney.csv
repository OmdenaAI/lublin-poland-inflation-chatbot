 I used to save very little, going out every Friday/Saturday night and on a few weeknights as I work 2nd shift and sometimes you just want a drink at 10pm after a long day. I have cut that down to only a few weeknights a month and a Saturday night here and there and am saving some money but not as much as I would like. I also try eating out less and still have trouble meeting money goals.

Other expenses I have are rent, school loans, car payments/gas, groceries/household items, bills... I pay it all as I live alone. Full honesty I spend about 170 a month on weed as well but its a mental health expense so not really looking to cut that out either. 

I have thought about the ""side hustle"" before but with my jobs schedule it is difficult to find anything that can work around that. I usually work second shift but it varies because I work in health care and my job is staffed 24/7. 

Its not that I am broke, its just that I wasnt able to spend as much on friends and family for Christmas as I wanted.

I had atleast 5k in savings but that seemed to have run out since I recently moved into a new apartment with my sister. I find myself now living paycheck to paycheck. I’m grateful it’s not like I’m struggling to eat or to survive but I hate to see nothing in my savings account. How am I able to start putting money aside and not touching it? I don’t have bad tendencies with money such as being a shopaholic or wasting money on unnecessary things. I tried the budget route but it seems like my money goes by faster that way. Any suggestions or tips ?   I was thinking maybe I can ask to be paid biweekly maybe that will be more helpful? Please I really need advice 

For reference:

•my sister and I do Uber to work and we take turns one week on and off

• I want to save up for a car as I do not want to be taking Ubers everywhere and I know that will ultimately help with my saving 

• my and my sister spilt every bill, rent and any expenses that go towards the house


EDIT* JUST TO CLARIFY:

*MY SAVINGS WERE GONE BEFORE I MOVED!

*I DID NOT PAY FOR EVERYTHING MY FRIENDS HAD OR NEEDED- I SUPPLIED THE HOUSE AND THEY USED IT. WHEN WE WENT OUT THEY PAID FOR THEIR OWN FOOD AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY BOUGHT, THEY JUST WOULD NOT PITCH IN FOR UBERS THERE OR BACK. OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE.

*I KNOW CUTTING OUT ON UBERS WILL HELP ME SAVE MORE MONEY BUT THATS NOT AN OPTION RIGHT NOW IT IS MORE A FORM OF THE ONLY TRNASPORTATION I HAVE. I THINK OF IT AS GAS MONEY IF I HAD A CAR. MY UBERS ARE NOT EXPENSIVE AT LEAST TO ME I DO PAY FOR THE 1 YEAR MEMBERSHIP UBERONE WHERE I GET DISCOUNTS AND FREE UBER RIDES. IN TOTAL IN A WEEK I WASTE ROUGHLY $100 NOT EVEN I MAY HAVE ATLEAST 50 LEFT FROM THAT.

I WAS NEVER TAUGHT HOW TO SAVE. MY MOTHER WOULD JUST SAY TO NOT WASTE MONEY ON STUPID THINGS. SO IM NOT AWARE ON IT. I JUST KNOW I HAVE TO HAVE MONEY SAVED UP. I WORKED IN A RESTURANT AND COFFEE SHOP WHERE I GOT TIPS I WOULDNT TOUCH MY PAYCHECKS SO THATS HOW I WAS ABLE TO SAVE UP MONEY IN 4 MONTHS. RECENTLY WORKING A ""9-5"" AND HAVING TO TOUCH EACH PAYCHECK IS NEW TO ME SO IM FINDING IT HARD TI SAVE MONEY AND ""BUDGET""

I have money anxiety and need internet strangers reassurance!,7,z5xxwk,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/z5xxwk/i_have_money_anxiety_and_need_internet_strangers/,4,"I hate talking money with my friends and family. My friends are wreckless spenders that don’t care about financial security and my family are condescending. I have horrible money anxiety and just need someone to reassure me 😭

I’m 21 and have been saving for roughly 6 months. I’ve got about $9k in personal savings/sinking accounts. I want to invest as soon as possible but feel that a well established emergency fund is more important. When should I start to consider investing? 

Admittedly my emergency fund is growing slower than some other savings accounts but it is receiving the highest interest rate (I contribute to it every pay, the amount differs each pay). Is this terrible?

Background info is that I’m funnelling most money into savings accounts to use for moving out of home soon. I’m terrified of the financial responsibilities of living out of home and have established saving/sinking accounts for just about every expense I have/anticipate (leisure, credit, self maintenance, health, smile, investing, renting, household expenses, car, emergency fund). Aside from my daily expenses accounts I also have shared accounts with my boyfriend and best friend with a combined balance of $1.5k. I seem to manage all these accounts really well and they help a lot in the allocation of my income. I just wonder if anyone thinks there are ways to optimise my saving? 

My essential expenses are minimal for now (employer pays my phone, I carpool to work, I pay $200/fn in rent and split house bills 4 ways) but I have no clue what it will be like when I move out of home soon. My annual take home salary is $62k  and I’ve considered getting a casual job to work overnights/weekends to make some extra money. I feel like I started saving so late and need to make up for it. I want to be financially secure soon and for the rest of my life but is it possible without working myself to death?

I’ve also been salary sacrificing $200/fortnight to my super for the last 2 years and am considering making additional contributions after putting some extra aside and getting my tax back. It feels like the right thing to do but should it wait until my emergency fund is complete? 

I have no debt and am terrified of it. I want to avoid it for as long as possible. I’m saving most of my income at the moment because I know that the coming years are likely to be expensive for me once renting a place and buying a car. The cost of children recently crossed my mind and hasn’t left since. When were you all financially ready for kids!?! Do I start saving for that now too?!

What am I doing right/wrong? Any tips to help me save more effectively? Is a second job over kill? Please help!",1669545014.0

How to save money choosing a VPN?,6,z49qwl,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/z49qwl/how_to_save_money_choosing_a_vpn/,1,"Black Friday and Cyber Monday is an excellent time to get various software cheaper and VPN is not an exception. It’s easy to get lost among all the great offers and flashy ads and end up with a product that might not necessarily fit your needs and you’ll end up wasting money. That’s why I want to share with you this great [vpn comparison table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ijfqfLrJWLUVBfJZ_YalVpstWsjw-JGzkvMd6u2jqEk/edit#gid=231869418) I found on r/VPN.

**Bonus:** unethical life pro tip if you get a VPN - if you need some type of expensive software, but you do not want to pirate, make sure to check out prices while connected to different countries via VPN! I know for a fact that sometimes US prices are lower than UK, but make sure to check out countries in Europe or South America as well.

**How to choose a VPN?**

The table has all main providers as well as some smaller ones and evaluates them on various criteria. All you have to do is define what you need from a VPN and which criteria is most relevant to you. Most importantly this table also includes all the special offers so it will save you money for sure.

If you are unclear what to pay the most attention to while choosing a VPN, here are some aspects that I find the most important:

**Audited no log policy** \- one of the main reasons for using a VPN is privacy and security of personal details, hence it is important that your VPN provider does not keep any logs on you. Meaning - as little information as possible should be recorded. Many providers claim they have a no-log policy, however it is very important for that policy to be independently audited. Make sure to check your provider’s ToS and privacy policy - there are cases when sneaky providers claim they have no logs, but when you check the documentation it turns out that logs are kept!

**Jurisdiction** \- it is no less important where the VPN provider is based as they have to answer to the country’s data laws. If the company is based in a country with many data retention laws and policies in place to violate citizens’ privacy, it’s not good news for you. To maintain as much privacy as possible, look for a score 5 in jurisdiction criteria. It is always better to be safe than sorry, as in some countries VPN can be randomly forced to start logging data.

**Servers owned** \- if you’re getting a vpn you most likely want to reach geo-restricted content, that is why it’s important to make sure that a VPN has many locations and many servers.  The better the country coverage the more content for you! Moreover, if there are more servers they do not get over-crowded often, hence the speeds tend to be better.

What is not included in the VPN table but I think is important, is how many devices one subscription covers. Make sure to pay attention to that as well, it’s the best if one sub covers VPN needs for the whole family.

Hope it helps!",1669370766.0

I’ve been reading a lot on what you can actually save on and what you should pass on for Black Friday/Cyber Monday/etc. What have you all read? Here’s what I found are the best things to focus on:

* Some electronics - laptops, kindles, headphones/airpods
* Small appliances and gadgets
* Home goods
* TVs - not the cheapest of the cheap ones though!

**How should you shop?**

* Start your gift search early
* Search for coupon codes - I’ve heard good things about Rakuten, Honey, etc.
* Shop online - brick and mortar Black Friday shopping still exists, but it seems to be easier to get what you want online. Also, it’s nice to be in your pjs.
* Use websites and apps - NerdWallet put out a good article on this [https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/best-apps-black-friday-shopping](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/shopping/best-apps-black-friday-shopping)
* Don’t get trapped in \*\*all the excitement and hype\*\* - the world will not end if you don’t get exactly what you want
* Track price changes of the things you really want - I’ve heard good things about Camel Camel Camel or Keepa for Amazon tracking
* Remember it’s not just about Black Friday:
   * Small Business Saturday
   * Cyber Monday
   * Green Monday
* If you’re a member of any loyalty programs, don’t forget about special deals you may get there
* Follow social media hashtags like #blackfriday #smallbusinesssaturday #cybermonday - you’ll likely find many brands advertising good deals

**How do you keep your wallet from lighting on fire?**

* Create a list of everyone and everything you need to buy for THEN set a budget for each person and stick to it
* Track your spending using an app
* Don’t accrue credit card debt you won’t be able to pay off in full
* If you’re a savvy credit card user - game your purchases so you also maximize points/rewards
* Be aware of your thoughts and feelings while shopping. If you’re feeling impulsive - leave the store or walk away from your laptop. Take a breath. Take a break. Impulsivity is a killer of good personal finance habits.
* A little planning and forethought can save you a ton of money",1669223510.0

- Biking instead of driving to places near home 
- Keeping car windows rolled up and only using A/C as needed (windows being down affects the aerodynamics of your car and can cause it to get up to 20% less mileage on a full tank. A/C affects gas mileage as well)
- Buying necessities such as toilet paper, body wash and water in BULK
- No buying alcohol or weed (they do nothing for you it’s all in your head)
- No leaving the house multiple times per day (do all your errands and tasks in 1 go)
- No eating out or fast food. There’s food at home. 
- Comb through all your subscriptions and see which ones you can go without. 
- You don’t need to go out and spend money to have fun these days. There are tons of ways to entertain yourself at home for free such as doing home workouts, meditating, playing video games, watching TV/Movies, FaceTiming friends, etc…
- No paying for Netflix/Hulu/etc… (I guarantee one of your friends are willing to give you the password to theirs)
- No chasing women (As a man, most women are a financial liability. A woman who wants you for you will come along eventually on her own with little to no effort on your end as long as you strive to be the highest version of yourself and stay on your purpose)
- Be very proactive about your health(Exercise and healthy eating isn’t optional. It’s nature’s medicine. Neglecting it will cost you big time in the long run)
- Only buy things online so you can compare prices from multiple different places
- Search Google for coupons before making any online purchase(coupons are literally EVERYWHERE)
- You don’t need new clothes
- If you travel often, try to stick to a specific airline and sign up for their credit card for massive savings and priority boarding 
- Take advantage of opportunities to receive free food from friends, family, work, events at your college/university etc… (some days, between my job, my university, and my parents, I will eat 3 full course meals without spending a single dollar) 
- Stay with your parents but if you HAVE to move out, move in with roommates. 
- INVEST your newfound savings. Don’t let them sit and depreciate in a savings account.",1668626375.0

How long will it take to buy another property?,2,yqo6f7,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/yqo6f7/how_long_will_it_take_to_buy_another_property/,20,"So I make about 2100$ after taxes a month. These are my total bills

Internet: 55
Insurance: 100
Trash: 25

Total: 1300$ not including gas for car or food.

It’s just myself and all these bills are high balled in case of bill spike. So I’m assuming 200$ a month for food, and about 150$ a month for gas? 

So I’m left with about $350 for savings. I just feel like it’s a piss poor amount for my savings. I would like to at least save 500$ a month. I work at a school and I do after school which is an extra 1000$ a month for about 6 months. I want to save that plus 500$ a month. So my yearly savings are close to 12k a year.

Our goal is to make this much simpler for people by reducing the friction involved in comparing prices across different supermarkets which is, as it stands, a particularly time-consuming task (the poorest households are also the most time-poor).

Turn your TV off at the wall!!!,10,ymrjfo,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/ymrjfo/turn_your_tv_off_at_the_wall/,20,"I have a Sony Bravia smart TV and with the ongoing energy crisis I decided to test the energy use of all my home appliances to see where I can save. My Sony TV was using a constant 15-20W when on standby. On my current tariff that's around £50 per year. If you were given the choice of paying a £50 per year subscription to be able to turn your TV on a bit faster then would you? Because I wouldn't.

Solution - Easiest: Turn the TV off at the wall when your not using it.

Solution - Less Easy: Buy a smart plug and set a routine to turn the plug off at the wall when it isnt normally being used. So it only turns on at the wall between 5pm and midnight for example. So when you want to watch it its still just a press of the button on your remote.

Solution - Advanced: Setup a smart plug with home assistant. By connecting both my smart TV and the smart plug to home assistant I can monitor what state the TV is in. So now if the TV is turned off with the remote it is automatically turned off at the wall 30 seconds later. If the TV is in an Idle state for 10 minutes (Paused, home screen, ect) then the TV is first turned off and then again turned off at the wall 30 seconds later.

Smart plugs are at most £20 so they can quickly pay for themselves if your appliances are draining this much power when on standby.",1667648348.0

9 Money Saving Tips that have saved me some major Cash,25,y8z084,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/y8z084/9_money_saving_tips_that_have_saved_me_some_major/,7,"If you are feeling the burn OUTSIDE of the gym, you might be a victim of inflation nation. Let’s talk tips to keep a few, or maybe even many, extra dollars in your pocket. You earned it, don’t give it all away.

The Big Three

When talking about saving money, there are thousands of little things that can save you a buck or two, but you may be better served by looking for the bigger wins.

My first 6 tips come from what I am going to refer to as the “BIG THREE”: Housing, Transportation, and Food. On average, these three categories tend to take up a good portion a monthly cashflow.

ROOMMATES Nothing says “I’m an adult” more than having your own place. Well, except maybe being able to pay your bills. Especially in locations where rents are high, adding a roommate to your household can be a huge win. For all my fellow introverts out there, I know it can feel like a big sacrifice, but adopt a roommate you really love, or one who has a different schedule than your own. You might find you have the place to yourself more than you anticipated. I know this is a change that might be hard to make today, or even within the next few months, but keep it in the back of your mind as your lease comes up for renewal. (SAVINGS $400-$500/mo.)‍

TRANSPORTATION Even as we see a bit of a break in the gas price surge, it’s always a good idea to evaluate your transportation practices. If there is little flexibility in your options to get to work, like carpooling or biking, there is still probably some dollars to be saved on nights and weekends. Get thoughtful with your errands so you can knock them out in one trip rather than a nightly ride in the gas guzzler. For my city folk, skip the cab, and learn a new bus route. (SAVINGS $15-$40/mo.)‍

GROCERY STORE For those who don’t know, this is the place where you buy food to bring into your home, and then you can eat it whenever you want. Most of the time it’s cheaper, too! Get that store savings card, make a list, and look for products you enjoy that happen to be on sale this week. Even if, like me, you’re a creature of habit, don’t be afraid to choose a new brand of peanut butter if it’s going to save you a few bucks! (SAVINGS $50-$100/mo.)

Ok, I know the grocery store might not be as exciting as checking out all the newest culinary delights, so let’s get into some money savers when dining out. ‍‍

*WHERE* ARE YOU EATING?: There can be a big monetary difference between full service restaurants and places where you order at the counter. DO NOT save extra money by being a bad tipper! If you are choosing to eat at a restaurant with a waitstaff, calculate that extra 20% (or more) in your brain before you enter the door. If it’s going to be too much of a stretch to tip, be kind to our friends in the service industry and come back when it’s more doable. (SAVINGS $50-$200/mo.)‍

RESTAURANT *EXTRAS*: You can have a great experience, get a good meal, and be a generous tipper without having to break the bank. Restaurants love to catch you with the extras. Opt for water over alcohol or soda, share an appetizer, and maybe skip the meat tonight. You’d be surprised how much you can reduce the bill by choosing just one of these alternatives. Or do all three. (SAVINGS $50-$200/mo.)‍

FREQUENCY: If you are eating at restaurants every night, you might find the novelty wearing off quick, and your paycheck disappearing even quicker. Try to space out your trips to restaurants and maybe replace them with date nights cooking at home. If you are wondering where the food will come from, see above: (GROCERY STORE). (SAVINGS $50-$250/mo.)

‍Ok, let’s wrap this up with a couple of miscellaneous items outside of the big three. ‍

SUBSCRIPTIONS: If you are scrolling your subscription menus more than watching the content, it may be time to eliminate a service or two. If you want to go one step further, pull out those credit card statements and see if you have forgotten to cancel any subscriptions you no longer use. (SAVINGS $15-$100/mo.)‍

CLOTHING: Before you plan another shopping trip, take a deep dive into your closet and take stock of what you own and the frequency in which you wear your items. Remove things you doubt you will wear again and get yourself to a second hand store. (Trigger warning: selling your clothes at certain second hand stores can cause you to question all of your life choices.) If they decide your items are worthy of purchase, they usually offer you cash or store credit. Take a look around and your 5 unworn pieces might turn into your new favorite vintage shirt! (SAVINGS $15-$30/mo.)‍

CELL PHONE: “Hello? Can you hear me?” There is a lot of money to be saved here. With just a bit of research and no change in habit I was able to reduce my monthly cell phone plan from $118 to $35. Check out your previous data usage and question the need for the unlimited plan. WIFI is EVERYWHERE. Ask if your provider has a cheaper prepaid plan (all you’re really doing is paying on a different date), and try to take advantage of any loyalty programs. If you’ve exhausted all efforts, threaten to leave. It’s funny how often a new offer will suddenly “pop up” in these instances. Also, just because we have been placed into a system with a standard 2 year payment plan, does not mean you need to upgrade your device on this schedule. Think of your cell phone like a car: if it has a bad battery or a shattered windshield, replace the parts, not the whole! (SAVINGS $20-$80/mo.)

I believe if you take advantage of just a few of these tips, you might be surprised at how quickly you can free up between $150-$300/mo. without too much sweat.",1666274290.0

"New job, recent graduate trying to save money",2,xuyhda,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/xuyhda/new_job_recent_graduate_trying_to_save_money/,3,"I'm 22 y/o, I will be starting a part-time job next week that pays $16 hourly, I have 36k in debt (but will probably be lower once the debt relief hits), and am still living with my parents. I am in a very fortunate spot, where my parents are willing to provide me a place to stay as long as I'm not a bum and pay for my own car insurance, but I want to start saving so I can move out as quickly as possible. I would like to move out now, but I want to move straight into my own home and don't want to throw away money by renting. 

As of now, my plan is to open a checking account, put roughly 30% of my check into it (and increase if I can squeeze some more out of it once I know my monthly expenses), and open roughly 2 credit cards to start building my credit which is nonexistent at the moment. This job is a bit inconsistent, but when it's busy, it gets very busy so I am planning on applying to substitute in my school district on days when I don't have work. I also plan to go full-time at my job by the beginning of 2023 if all goes well.

Since I have no idea what my yearly income or average monthly living costs are, I cannot provide much information. My biggest monthly expenses will probably be my car insurance (which I have not figured out yet) and my student loans. I will be paying for some of my own food, protein powder, miscellaneous wants, and investing in my freelance job (which makes very little to no money on a monthly basis right now). I don't drink or do drugs, but I do play video games, and when the time comes that a new game is out, I rarely buy it because I don't have the time to so I wouldn't consider it a big portion of my spending. 

I am very new to the world of managing my finances and I know I am unable to provide a lot of information, but I would appreciate any input or general advice! I have very limited knowledge on saving, stocks, etc. so any knowledge or advice you can share I would greatly appreciate (as well as any other ways to make money on the side if you know any).

* No hassle and faff of time spent having to research your options to find the best deal if in a long contract (if in a short one you'd have to do this research more often when your current deal is close to expiring)

**Pros of short contract**

A Little History Of Savings And A Great Tip At The End!,4,wo7kn5,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/wo7kn5/a_little_history_of_savings_and_a_great_tip_at/,0,"A Little History Of Savings And A Great Tip At The End!

In the classic film ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’, the James Stewart character George Bailey runs a small Savings and Loans company until his nemesis, Mr Potter, capitalises on an error made by one of the employees and tries to ruin George and take over the town.

It all works out in the end with a bit of divine intervention, and if you haven’t seen the movie, I recommend you do as it’s a Christmas classic.

The company at the centre of the town and the heart of the community was typical of 1940s America and of co-ops and banks all across the UK and Europe. Savings were and are a means of providing a ‘cushion’ for the unexpected and, at the same time, allowing others to borrow from the funds for new homes, cars, holidays and ways of improving lives.

My great granny liked to save. She was very working class and didn’t have money in a high street bank because there weren’t high streets in her rural community. But she bought post office savings stamps, collected green shield stamps, belonged to the co-op which had dividends and sadly, in a less enlightened time, collected cigarette coupons. She was known to say, ‘Charlie, see if you can finish that pack of No 6, and we can get that toaster’.

For many people, having a little money set aside makes them feel more secure and generally happier, but for some, that is a luxury they can’t afford. In recent times, firstly with Covid affecting communities worldwide and now prices for food, petrol and energy rising considerably, times have been extra tough. In a study conducted by MIND, there was evidence to suggest that money worries caused sleeplessness, anxiety, depression and a host of other issues.

What is clear is that spending habits have changed rapidly with Covid, with e-commerce and internet purchases outstripping many traditional high street retail.

But for the majority of us, a balance of having some of the treats we might like and having a little to protect us from the unexpected is the way forward. Our saving habits often begin with a money box or piggy bank. The invention of the piggy bank was over 600 years ago when people would use pots to store what money they had. Over time the pronunciation of the word for clay became more like ‘pig’, and more people would request for the ‘pygg’ pots to be shaped like pigs.

But the origin of the word savings is lost in the mists of time. Some say it comes from the Arabic word ""hurr” and means ""of free condition"". It refers to a slave or prisoner who made savings to recover his freedom. From the very beginning, saving has been associated with the idea of freedom to build a better future. Others from the Latin ‘saven’ which means ""to deliver from some danger; rescue from peril, bring to safety.""

Whatever your spending habits; impulsive, thrifty or a bit of both, it makes sense to have, if possible, that little extra to cope with life’s curveballs. By saving money regularly, you can achieve some of your goals a little easier, and it sets a good example to our children that money is earned and should be saved and spent wisely. There is an argument for better education of children and young people in the management of money as part of the curriculum.

In the meantime, there are less conventional ways of saving money that, regardless of income or circumstances, we can all access. Look at loyalty cards, and vouchers, schemes.

The best thing I have personally found is a [free](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/wm6jw1/slash_10_bonus_to_use_on_various_online_retailers/) browser extension on [r/beermoneyuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/) that lets you save on every purchase you make through their featured stores and costs nothing to use. It features popular stores like eBay. Groupon, B&Q, and a bunch of others and since using it, I haven’t paid full price for anything.

Have you tried the extension yet?

Save rent by living with parents VS Rent out for freedom,10,wdyqud,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/wdyqud/save_rent_by_living_with_parents_vs_rent_out_for/,12,"Finally after hard grinding at work and paying off all my debts, I am starting to save up. 

My goal this year was to finally get out of my parent's house. 

I have saved up enough to cover the deposit for the rent & necessities for my rental. 

While looking for apartments to rent, I thought to myself, why not save up more and just buy a property instead? 

The money I have right now is not enough to purchase a property, so if I wanted to go that route, I think I will have to live with my parents for about a year to save up for a downpayment & closing cost for a mortgage. On the bright side is that instead of paying rent, it will be a mortgage = an investment! 

I'm debating carefully now if my freedom is worth a rental. If I move out I will save up slower and will be able to purchase a property relatively slower. 

What do you guys think? Should I just stick with my parents little longer? 

or should I just get a rental and live freely? (My parents are not toxic, it's just that there are a few limitations living with them)",1659404462.0

I’ve been a lurker on here for a while. In general I do save a good amount of money each month, however, it really upsets me how much I spend on lunches. It’s like I cannot control myself at work. At the end of the month, I add it up and I’m talking $400 - $500 is spent on restaurant/fast food lunches. Part of my problem is that I hate staying inside the building at lunch time. I want to get the heck out of this place, and so almost everyday I end up in a restaurant at lunch…. Spending a small fortune $$$ 

I would like to go from $20 - $25 lunches each day, to like $2 - $4 lunches each day, but I lack discipline/ good ideas. 

Is there anyone else in the same boat as me? Maybe we can motivate each other to not spend like drunken sailors at lunch time 🤪🤪🤪

Also, are there any disciplined people out there that already cut out eating out at lunch time? What are your tricks?

I have already made 6 sandwiches that I can just grab and go in the morning. I estimate that my cost for each lunch will be about $4 roughly. Maybe less!

I recently created a new service designed to help students with the costs of school. So basically it’s a classified ads website simply just for students and their needs. In other words it’s like a kijiji yet only with categories that benefit students, for example some categories are textbooks, calculators, science instruments etc… It also has the option so that the seller can include a rough placement of where they are selling from, so that makes it easier for students in younger years to get the same textbook required for a course at a lesser price. Overall the goal is to help students find cheaper alternatives in a fast and easy way. If you’re an interested seller or buyer, please visit studentboom.com.

I am genuinely looking for any savings account recommendations, easy ways to stop spending urges and just all round advice. 

Keep in mind i am australian :)",1657458819.0

Should I be frugal in this situation or should I go for quality?,6,vl7an2,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/vl7an2/should_i_be_frugal_in_this_situation_or_should_i/,5," 

I'm a frugal person but for some things, it's occasionally important to spend a little more. Being frugal for so long has allowed me to save up to afford my first house. The reason i've been frugal is to achieve my dream of being a homeowner.

I'm going to need to buy lots of things to decorate the house as well as things like a sofa, television etc.

The house I'll be moving into won't be my ""forever home"". It's in pretty good condition so when I move, nothing desperately needs changing or fixing. There's things I'd like to change to make the house nicer but this is a ""want"" rather than a ""need"". They'd be ""nice to have"" things rather than essential, urgent renovations.

Part of me thinks I should be looking to ask friends and family if they have items they don't need and see if I can fill the house interior with things either for free or on the cheap. Eg my friend has a sofa that's a bit worn (but not to the point it looks vile) and she'll be getting a new one so I'm tempted to buy her worn one for my house I'll soon move into. However, a nice sofa can really make the living room look nice so I don't know whether I should splash out on a quality one.

As well as filling the house with items, some other things I'd like to add/change in the house that come with a price tag attached but aren't essential include:

* Get an outdoor rotating washing line (currently the house has a rope across the garden where they hang clothes on)
* Get a tumble dryer as currently there's only a washing machine
* Get a dishwasher as currently they just hand wash cutlery / crockery
* Get heated towel rails as currently there's somewhere to hang towels but it's not heated so the towels can smell since they don't dry as fast naturally
* Perhaps landscape the garden as it's huge but a bit ugly / nothing has been done with it to make best use of the space",1656257606.0
Should I open a 401k?,7,vjtro9,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/vjtro9/should_i_open_a_401k/,10,"Hi everyone!! I’m currently working and going to school and am starting to think seriously about saving for the future. I have my own savings account I put money in, but should I open a 401k? I work at Starbucks and they will match 100% of up to 5% of my pay. I am worried that taking out 5% of my already small paycheck and putting it away could affect me negatively but I also feel like I’m saving more than that on my own. I guess the upside though is I can always pull from my savings if I need the money. 

I guess I was just wondering what the pros and cons are?? Can someone also explain the diff between pre tax and after tax Roth accounts? I’ve looked around but I’m still quite confused about it, so I figured I would ask here! If this isn’t allowed please go ahead and delete it.

I’m 25 yrs old and I want to save towards a down payment on a house in about 3-4 years. 
I want to start by putting $100 of my savings every month into something better than a regular savings account. I want it to be pretty much risk-free so I know the yield won’t be great. 

Anyways, I’m wondering which type of short-term savings would be best: EE bonds, I bonds, or treasury note? Should I have all three of these? If I choose a savings bond, would EE bonds or I bonds be better if I want to take out the money in 3 years? (I’m aware of the penalties for early withdraw) Are any of these good for short-term?

I can't retain savings even though my salary is pretty nice,11,uyd030,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/uyd030/i_cant_retain_savings_even_though_my_salary_is/,8,"I (22F) have been living alone with 2 roommates and my cat for 6 months.

My job pays well. My rent and water/electricity + transportation (public transportation pass) + streaming services (Spotify and iCloud) + phone bill + TV/internet + cat food represent around 33% of my monthly income. Not too bad, I think(?)

I use a money tracking app to log all my spendings and these past few months I've paid so many things that I eventually mess up and forget and try again from scratch the following month. Only this month (May '22) have I managed to be 99% consistent with tracking so I can evaluate what the h-ll I'm doing wrong.

I admit, this is my first time supporting myself financially and I have a Scottish Fold cat that I really try to invest on because I know he is ""genetically doomed"". I get him to a nice vet and feed him 100% wet food made of just animal parts. He is vaxxed, chipped, no parasites, I build and get him things to try to catify the house little by little. His vet is amazing and affordable, I think! I am lucky.

I've also bought many nice things since I've moved alone; I don't usually get things just to get by, I do invest in pieces that will last and that I won't get rid of because I don't like them. This has included a bed, mattress, shoe/coat hanger, ergonomic chair, big desk, kitchen isle/cart, some clothes, etc.

I buy nice groceries/food and experiment with it. I have an analog hobby, but I'd say I don't run too fast through rolls because I don't go out much and I do it more for memories, not necessarily art.

I can proudly say that I have many sturdy, nice looking things that I think will last me a long time. Not in a hoarder like way; I usually give away to friends and roommates things I don't like or don't serve me anymore (I like to own things that actually make a difference in my day to day).

You might be wondering, ""so what's the problem?"". The problem is that I might be too obsessed with investing and not having boundaries. I can invest throughout the time, but I just feel like I have to do it NOW. At the moment. 

I also have a problem with restaurants/cafés or getting rides/uber eats because I'm very busy and have little time to prepare or do the dishes, or am late for the bus. Since I have roommates, I definitely feel like I have to do chores in the moment and can't leave it to the end of the day.

So yeah, biggest undoing is groceries/investing in furniture or home stuff (not bad, but in a way it's excessive and could wait a bit)/uber rides/uber eats/going to the office and getting lunch with workmates at a restaurant.

What do I do? I do put savings money to the side when I get paid, but towards the middle of the month I definitely start to run out of ""free money"" and start not caring about digging into savings (or worse, I've an emergency like vet/health/groceries).

TL;DR: I've a nice salary that covers all my expenses and beyond, I invest a lot on good things that last and give me a good life but I still have difficulty in setting limits, respecting them and responding to emergencies without blowing all of my savings.

Edit: I can see that you guys are a bit ahead of me in financial literacy (?) and thinking of my constant use of ""investing"" is misplaced. English is not my first language and I checked the dictionary anyway and it had this meaning:
a thing that is worth buying because it may be profitable or useful in the future.
""freezers really are a good investment for the elderly""
That's kinda what I mean. Maybe in my mother language it makes more sense to use it this way.

Also I'm more comfortable and basing my future actions still on the money I receive on my bank account, and not looking into any stocks/crypto etc. My money-money, yknow?

Edit 2: It was brought to my attention that ""thought out purchases"" is a better term to describe all my ""investments"". So yeah, that's what I mean!",1653586667.0

Tired of your bill going up? Want to save money? SlimBill can help,1,ur9nkd,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/ur9nkd/tired_of_your_bill_going_up_want_to_save_money/,0,"Do you feel like your bill prices are constantly creeping up?

We're here to change that with the launch of SlimBill. SlimBill is a bill negotiation service with a priority of helping you save your hard-earned money by negotiating lower rates on residential/personal and business bills, such as cable, satellite TV/radio, internet, cell phone, home security, and waste removal bills, including any bundled services. We also negotiate early-termination fees (ETFs). We currently do not negotiate utilities such as electric, water, and natural gas.

If you're interested, please go to [https://www.slimbill.co](https://www.slimbill.co/) and then scroll down and click Get Started. I also encourage you to read our frequently asked questions by clicking FAQs. Information regarding our fee can be found below.

Every dollar is vital in today's economic climate, so if we can save you money, it makes us smile here at SlimBill!

The amount we charge equals 45% of the negotiated monthly savings (and one-time savings in some cases) for each service, but you pay nothing if we’re unable to negotiate a lower price. In the case of negotiated ETFs, we charge a fee equal to 45% of the total ETF savings.

For example, if we're able to lower your bill by $50/month for one year,\* you pay SlimBill $22.50/month for that year for our negotiation service and save $27.50/month on your bill for that year. That's $330 in savings for one year. If we can do this for five of your services, for example, that's $1,650 in savings for one year. Examples of one-time savings include but aren’t limited to negotiated savings on data overages or negotiated credit for a service outage.

\*The amount and length of savings vary depending on what we can successfully negotiate with your provider(s).",1652745635.0

She says if I need money I just have to ask, but I have my hobbies and private life, where I don‘t want to tell my mom everytime why I need the money. I also feel bad to ask for money, when it is just about me havin fun (getting drinks with my friends, for brunch etc., nothing like drugs and parties lol), bc my mom always complains about having no money.
My hobby is Bouldering once a week (9$) and I didn‘t tell my mom, bc I don‘t know how she will react, but I‘m 100% sure, she won‘t like it and will persuade me to stop, bc of costs and bc I have no time for studying then.
I stopped going out with friends, maybe once a month and stopped buying clothes and makeup, so I can afford Bouldering.
But at the end of the month I still have barely any money left. And this is so frustrating. I‘m also jealous, when I watch instagram stories. There are people who learn in cafes everyday or eating out once a week. I don‘t want to be super rich, but I am so frustrated that I can‘t even buy a 15$ tshirt once a month or learn in a cafe twice a week. (I could, but I couldn‘t save ANY money then)
Maybe my standards are too high for my situation, but I am surrounded by friends, who have supportive parents, who don‘t want to control u financially(Just my mom tbh, my dad has zero power in our family) and I always end up comparing myself with my friends.

Yes I feel like an asshole wanting things I can‘t afford and kinda blaming my mom, but we are not that poor to live on a existential minimum and I don‘t want to cut off all my friends,study only and looking bad, bc I have no money.

Simple Ways to Maximize Your Savings Rate,3,u98nfl,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/u98nfl/simple_ways_to_maximize_your_savings_rate/,0,"Anyone who has ever tried to save money knows that it is not always easy. There are a million ways to spend money, and often it seems like there are very few ways to save. However, there are some simple things that anyone can do to increase their savings rate. 

One of the easiest ways to save money is to set aside a fixed amount each month. This can be done by setting up a separate savings account or by investing in a certificate of deposit. Another way to increase your savings rate is to take advantage of employer matching programs. Many employers will match a certain percentage of employee contributions, effectively giving employees a raise.

Individuals can also increase their savings rate by automating their finances. By setting up automatic transfers from their checking account to their savings account, people can ensure that they are always making progress on their financial goals. By following these simple tips, anyone can boost their savings rate and start on the path to financial security.

[**The Free Budgeteer**](https://thefreebudgeteer.com/) is always looking for ways to help you save money. Here are some simple tips to help you maximize your savings rate:

1. Make a budget and stick to it. This may seem obvious, but it's worth repeating. A budget is essential for ensuring that you're not spending more than you can afford.

2. Automating your savings. This can be done through your employer's payroll system or by setting up a direct deposit from your checking account to your savings account. Automating your savings ensures that you're less likely to spend the money on something else.

3. Invest in yourself. One of the best ways to save money is to invest in yourself. This can include taking courses, networking, or attending events that will help you advance in your career. By investing in yourself, you're ensuring that you'll be able to earn more money and save more in the long run.

Following these simple tips, you can be sure that you'll be well on your way to maximizing your savings rate.

How to choose the right savings account?,3,u96amt,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/u96amt/how_to_choose_the_right_savings_account/,0,"&#x200B;

***“Every decision brings with it some good, some bad, some lessons, and some luck. The only thing that’s for sure is that indecision steals many years from many people who wind up wishing they’d just had the courage to leap.” Doe Zantamata***

Life revolves around making decisions about every aspect of life, from what food to eat, where to go on holiday, where to study, what career to pursue, and other decisions such as financial decisions. Deciding on the [**best saving account**](https://www.intellisaving.com/) to open, based on your saving needs, is yet another decision that many make. According to the Bank of England’s findings, approximately more than £200bn was deposited into saving accounts since 2020s lockdowns. However, the cost of living has become more expensive through the rise in inflation, which can have a detrimental effect on several different aspects of life, such as an increase in rent, food, transport, and how much interest you make in your savings. For instance, an increase in inflation has a negative effect on interest rates, as money will decrease in value when you withdraw compared to when you first deposited the money into the account.

**What is Inflation?**

The rate of inflation has increased over the years, inflation is when money decreases in value. The inflation rate is determined through the increase and decrease of prices and is tracked through numerous indices. Banks use the consumer prices index (CPI) to document the cost of various items such as food, transport, and entertainment. In October 2021, inflation increased to 4.2%, whereas this was 3.1% the previous month, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The interest rate on savings should not be less than the inflation rate; otherwise, your money is not getting the best value for money. If you are getting a higher interest rate that is more than the inflation rate, then investing your money into a saving account is likely to be worthwhile investment. Fixed-rate bonds typically have the best interest rates, but they can have a downside as they have restrictions on withdrawals or extra payments.

In 2020 it was found that 6.50% of people in the UK have no savings; this could be due to not being well informed on the best banking account for their saving needs. The decision of which saving account to choose based on your needs is entirely up to you, but it is essential to be well informed before taking the plunge. So below is some more information on what to consider when choosing the right saving account for your saving requirements.

**What saving goals do you currently have?**

First, you need to establish what your saving goals are? If you are saving for a short-term goal such as a holiday or new bathroom, easy access accounts are ideal for this saving need as you will not be penalised for withdrawing from this account.

If your goal is a long-term goal, a fixed-term goal may be better. Whereas a regular savings account will be ideal for saving on a more regular basis as you must deposit money every month but give some of the best interest rates.

**How often do you intend to access the account?**

Before opening a [**savings account**](https://www.intellisaving.com/), it is essential to consider how likely you are to withdraw money because most saving accounts have rules around accessing the account, and some are stricter than others. Usually, the more stringent the rules of an account, the better the interest rate you will get on your savings. Although easy access accounts are the most flexible accounts as you can withdraw as often as you need without being penalised, they have lower interest rates than other saving accounts, such as fixed-rate saving accounts. A fixed-rate account will mean you have to keep your funds stored away for a specific time which is great for those with long-term saving goals.

**Are you required to deposit a specific amount each month?**

Some saving accounts/ building societies may require you to deposit a specific amount to open an account each month; for instance, most regular saving accounts and most other providers require savers to deposit a minimum of £25 per month

**Do saving accounts require you to pay tax?**

In most cases, savers do not pay tax for their savings if they earn less than £1,000 in interest and are basic taxpayers. However, taxpayers who pay a higher rate have a threshold of £500, and anyone who has a 45% rate of income tax is not entitled to an allowance. Over 80% of taxpayers currently pay tax at the introductory rate in the UK, whilst 13% pay a higher tax rate. Cash ISA is one option that higher taxpayers or those with no allowance could opt for as you don’t pay tax on Cash ISA.

**What is Personal savings allowance?**

Personal savings allowance works by banks or building society paying all interest gross without charging tax, which means that you can sit back and relax if your collective income from your savings is under your personal allowance. Prior to this system being put in place the old system would have involved the bank or financial institute automatically deducting 20% from any savings interest.

**How would the saving interest be paid?**

The interest on savings can be paid into your account annually, quarterly, monthly or on a agreed date. The interest could be compounded or ‘paid away’ in your account; the interest has to be paid into another account if your savings are paid away. However, your account balance is included when interest is not paid away. Compounded interest is when interest is added again in the future; this interest is added to your original balance, along with your first interest payment.

**What does AER Stand for?**

AER stands for annual equivalent rate, which compares saving accounts. AER presumes that you maintain your funds in a specific account for a year while also considering other factors that give a more precise overview than the gross rate.

**What are the risks associated with a saving account?**

Generally, saving accounts with established banks and building societies are usually considered low risk. The financial services compensation scheme usually protects savings of up to £85,000. However, sometimes returns can be minimal; for those who are less hesitant to take risks, there are other types of investments involving more risk, such as stocks and shares, which could also increase or decrease in value.

**Are there any saving apps that can track my saving accounts?**

[**Intellisaving**](https://www.intellisaving.com/) is the best app for finance management as the platform is ideal for integrating and tracking multiple saving and interest-bearing accounts within one single platform. The Intellisaving smart saving account application is also home to many features that make every user’s saving journey run smoothly. Every user has a personalised portfolio with their financial summary that includes balances and returns, a comparison feature that shows the highest interest rates across each saving category (e.g. Regular saving account) at present, a watchlist to add saving accounts that have sparked your curiosity. This app for saving enables users to manage their finances more strategically.

Different decisions can shape our lives in different ways, some change our lives for the better, and some teach us lessons about what paths to avoid in future. Choosing what saving account is right for you is an important decision like many decisions we must make in life, as saving now could be your key to a more stable financial future. As Tony Robben says, “It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.”

Current advice on choosing the right saving account shows that there are many factors to consider before selecting a saving account that best matches your saving needs, with inflation and interest rate being among the most significant factors to consider when opening an account as these could decrease the buying potential of your money. There is a range of saving accounts for different saving needs, which means that most savers are likely to find a saving account that is the right fit for them. Once you have chosen your saving account, you can integrate the account to Intellisaving to facilitate your saving path through our catalogue of features lessening the weight upon your shoulders. If you choose an account that is not ideal for you, don’t worry as no matter how stringent the rules a bank of financial institute imposes on a saving account, such as having to invest in the account for at least a year, the time will come where you will have another chance, an opportunity to open another saving account that is better suited to your requirements.",1650602267.0

After toiling hard in schools, colleges and universities for 28 years of my life, I have finally started my first job. For context, I am a Ph.D. and therefore had a late career start. I was earning peanuts as my Ph.D. stipend and that was barely enough for managing daily expenses. 

So when I started my job last month, I had no savings whatsoever. Infact I had taken money from my mother and a friend. My first salary kinda went paying back what I had lent. The second went in the deposit for my rented apartment and in setting it up. I will have the next paycheck in the end of this month and I definitely want to start investing from then. 
I am a total novice in this field and a clean slate. I have started reading stuff and watching videos on YouTube but the more content I consume, the more confused I get! 

I am sure all the experienced folks here have some helpful tips on how I can save some money and also invest some part of it? 

FYI, I am a single woman working in Villach, Austria. The taxes here are brutal and even though I am employed with one of the biggest companies in my field, I only get close to 2500 Euros in hand every month. Off that, 650 euros goes in the rent, electricity and internet. I walk or travel by public transport mostly (the ticket for which is funded by my company), don't socialize as I am immunocompromised and COVID sucks and eat home cooked meals on most days. These are just basic details and ballpark numbers so that you all could guide me best!

Where to live to save a lot of money,0,ttsbje,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/ttsbje/where_to_live_to_save_a_lot_of_money/,5,"Hi all,

I will soon be on a two year career break and would love to hear any advice people have to where to live/work to save a significant amount of money.

Some context, I'm in my late twenties and taking a career break for a number of reasons:

1) I have been working with the same organisation (gov department) since I was 22 and need a change of scenery.

2) I have lived in Ireland pretty much all my life and would like to live elsewhere before possibly setting up here for life.

3) The job I currently have is not well paid (40k) however I should not have too much difficulty going up two grades to 70k per year in the not so distant future. The thing is 40k in Dublin does not go very far, and makes purchasing a home near impossible. I'm hoping to move somewhere for 2 years that will allow me to save a large deposit in order to be able to afford a home. The mortgage repayments on the kind of property I would hope to buy would be less then the current rent costs in Dublin.

I am a data analyst and will finish my MSc in Data Science soon and would like to work in this field. 


Why only 2 years/why stay in a low paying job etc? - my employment is very secure and allows for a good work/life balance with the opportunity for a shorter working year allowing me to take up to 13 weeks of unpaid leave a year on top of 20 days AL. This is something I would love to avail of in a few years when I return after sorting out my home base. Having seen the chaos after the 2007 recession, I highly value my secure job.

I am fortunate that my natural tastes lend to a relatively cheap life: I love camping, would much rather have someone over for dinner than go out for a meal, will wear the same clothes over and over, I spend most of my free time outdoors, spend an average of €15 per week on groceries eating delicious food of a mainly veg base. 

I have never had a lot of money and know how easily financial situations can change - hence in the long term preferring the lower paid job in favour of the job security.",1648824056.0

Often when renewing car insurance, some bills and subscription services like Netflix, there is a monthly and yearly option to pay. 
The yearly payment is normally a lot cheaper than the monthly payments, however not everyone can afford to pay a lump sum like that.

I used to pay monthly for things as I could never afford the lump sum. However, my wife and I basically agreed to save money and essentially not have an expensive social life for just 1 year.
No going out and spending £70 on a couple of meals for a date night. No going out drinking with friends etc..
Anything we did was cut down significantly and I’m not going to lie, it was a kinda crappy year.
However… 
The money we spent on all those things was saved up and then as our payment were due, we finally paid the yearly costs (for example Netflix would be £100 for a year instead of £10/month costing £120 a year).
We did it on car insurance, house insurance, Netflix etc… and it ended up we saved a good couple of hundred £.
Now we put away the monthly cost we used to pay each month and at the end of the year, we pay the yearly costs and have some left over to indulge :) 
I’d really recommend it!

**I'm 23 years old, and** [**I have savings/investments totaling over $101,000**](https://imgur.com/gallery/Xol3VWc)**.** I don't have significant assets or liabilities outside of my savings and investments, other than a $1K gaming laptop, so for all intents and purposes my net worth is synonymous with my savings and investments. Currently I have \~$3,000 in savings as my emergency fund for 3 months' worth of expenses, and \~$98,000 in investments (all in ETFs). I've actually invested around $102K but my investments are down in value right now - I strongly believe eventually they will rise again in value.

For added context I lived at home during university so I saved a lot of money on rent and food during that time. I'm living at home so I have free food and rent. My highest individual expense last year was buying a new gaming laptop that was around $1,000. My expenses are generally very low every month - occasionally I spend some money on groceries or to eat out or see a movie but that's about the extent of my expenses. As for my income I made around $45K-$50K in 2021. My occasional side hustles that are online tutoring and working for a family member for their business. Again, I'm also saving a lot right now because I don't pay rent or food.

I’ve used my savings for various things like moving and buying my own car (all by myself with no co-signers, I’m proud of myself for that) but for most of the time it just sits in my savings account. I currently have a little over $7k and feel like there’s potential for me to use this money to make me money. I’m terrified of losing it and would be scared to have less that $5k even tho that’s more than enough for me in case of emergency. I think because I’ve had at least $5k in savings since I was 18 I’m nervous to not have that cushion. 

I had saved up $2k for school specifically but I have no idea what I want to study and don’t want to pay more for my degree than I’d be making in whatever profession I pick (I want to be a teacher but don’t want to work two jobs for my ideal salary). I withdrew from a few of my classes when I was 18 and it dropped my gpa so I don’t qualify for financial aid and I don’t want to go into debt getting a loan. I would be down to use this money to invest in a career but I want to be sure it’s a good investment and not a waste of my time and money which I’m scared college would end up being. I also don’t want to commit to the 4 years to get a bachelors degree honestly. 

I was thinking about putting some of my money in a high interest savings account but I don’t understand how that stuff works. I want to get my savings back up to $10k but I work in the service industry so it’s hard for me to consistently put money away since my income is fairly inconsistent.

Which Bank Closes Accounts then gives the Money to the State?,14,s2ilxq,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/s2ilxq/which_bank_closes_accounts_then_gives_the_money/,10,"**Ally Bank**

Today, to my utter surprise, I have found out that my Ally savings account, which I thought was earning me money, was **closed** last year as a dormant account. I did not have lot of money in the account, around $500. Enough to earn some pennies on my money while not using it. So my plan was to leave it alone to see how much I could earn.  I left it alone and did  not check my account for 6 months, mind you my account has been active for 10+ years.

Knowing that I was earning money on the $500 dollars I had transferred, I decided today that it was time to check my account after the six month experiment.  So, I logged into my Ally App hoping to see $510 ($10 of interest) only to find out that I ***did not have an active banking account.*** My app account was still active but when trying to check my balance in the account it was GONE. Yes Gone. 

So I called Ally Bank. Come to find they closed my account around the  June 2021' timeframe.  Ally closed my account as ""dormant"" because of no activity. IT WAS EARNING INTEREST FOR GODs SAKE, isn't that what a savings account is for?  The Ally rep told me that they sent a letter to inform me but I had moved and did not receive it.  Why send a letter anyway?  Are they NOT an ONLINE BANKING company, why wouldn't they have sent me an email.  They do not do that he said.  So never received notification!! and my money was gone!!!!  

Ally offered no help whatsoever.  Told me that I need to contact ""The State"".  Thats it!  Contact who in the state.  He said the unclaimed property division.  In the state of Texas that is like a needle in a haystack of divisions.  The Ally rep continued to say that I have to contact the ""unclaimed property"" as the account has already been set to ""dormant"" and there was nothing he could do.  They,  Ally Bank, have turned the money over to the STATE. Yes, they gave it to the state!

After a few paychecks and saving the usual 20% of each, I’ve realized that with such a huge jump in income that I have no idea how much money I actually make. I’ve gone from barely affording rent each month and scraping by to… well, not that. 

Currently I am saving to move in the beginning of the summer and for a possible trip to Europe at the end of the summer. 

Additionally, I have a small amount of money on one credit card and the only loans I have are federal student loans (small amount) and a car loan.  All payments are pretty low and I don’t feel the need to hurry up and pay any of it off because they don’t inhibit me and are just on automatic withdrawals. My credit score is great. 

I want to be smart with my new finances and make sure I maximize my savings. Any tips on how to go about this, habits I could develop, apps to use even?",1641570736.0

Coinbase Crypto: 20k (At 15k right now holding And Planning when it gets to all time high to change to a stable coin like DAI or USDC)

But my savings aren't really going up. 

Well, I've been seeing a lot of ads for investment apps and I am impulsive by nature (which I'm trying to fix) so I thought I'd ask here. Is that something I should look into, or should I avoid it? 

I'm trying to sell crochet stuff as well as having 2 part time jobs (neither will give me full time, so I have no benefits; shocker right?) And I just got kicked off my dad's insurance since he moved out of state, so I'll have yet another bill to pay in the near future.

So should I invest, or should I trust in my ability to try to keep my impulse-buying in check? Because my savings hasn't really moved since I keep having to dip into it because of ""emergencies"". (I just had to pay a $600 vet bill 🥲)

Tldr: should I try investing and if so what's a pretty safe bet?",1634931033.0

Can I put my $10k in cash savings into an S&P index fund and essentially ELIMINATE the risk of losing a percentage of the $10k in savings at the time of liquidation 6 months later by selling ONLY the shares I purchased in PREVIOUS years (not 6 months ago) that gained 0% since the time of purchase?,1,qc4znk,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/qc4znk/can_i_put_my_10k_in_cash_savings_into_an_sp_index/,1,"Moving money out of bank-savings account (cash “savings” to be used in the next 3 to 6 months for a large purchase - not for “investing”) into stocks can get me a better return (higher than the current rate of inflation). But doing this exposes me to higher risks of losing a percentage of my ""savings"" should the share values drop at any time in the next 3 to 6 months. Would the scenario I present below enable me to essentially eliminate a net loss when I liquidate my stock shares when the stock value is down?

**Scenario**: Let's say I move my $10,000 out of my bank savings account and put it all into purchasing shares in the S&P500 index fund to add to the many shares I already purchased incrementally over the last 10 years. Six months later, I need to liquidate the $10,000 in shares but the index fund is down 10% from the day I purchased the $10,000 in shares.

**Question:** From a long-term investing stand point, am I avoiding the 10% in net loss when I pick and sell ONLY the shares I purchased in PREVIOUS years (not the shares I purchased 6 months ago) that have gained 0% since the time those shares were purchased (thus avoiding capital gains tax as well)? Or is it all a wash and hence taking the 10% in net loss is unavoidable?

If this actually works and it helps me avoid the risk of losses in savings when putting cash savings into an index fund (and avoid reducing the net number of shares I hold in the index fund), then why would I ever want keep my cash savings in a bank saving account or in the money market that loses its value (other than having to wait through the three day settlement period) when the inflation rate is higher than interest rates?",1634747838.0

Stable 9-5 job, decent money. The only big loan i have is my car which should be done next year.. No student loans either. The last couple of years just really taught me the importance of saving. I always have my coffee at home, bring my own lunch, cook at home, occasional shopping. 

I recently started Robinhood and bought a few stocks but I'm afraid im not cutout for it. *side question, is it worth investing with Robinhood in the long run? Should i stick with it? Why or why not? (might not be the right sub for this question but what the hell) 

I also saved quite a bit in the last year or so.. so all that said, is a high-yield savings account worth it for someone with my 'profile'? My main purpose would be growing it for future expenses/big purchases (like a house or new car).

How to Reduce Car Expenses and Save Money,3,pbvoes,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/pbvoes/how_to_reduce_car_expenses_and_save_money/,2,"Owning a car is not as easy as most of us thought. If you have a family, it is like an extra child you have to care for. And sometimes it can even bring about more anxieties than any of your kids. Your road partner should not eat up most of your money and attention to the point you are already missing out on your obligation to the more important things: your family, business and profession. Otherwise, that would certainly defeat the purpose of having a car.  Cars should be for your good and not the other way around. This article intends to put the costs of car ownership to a minimum.

Saving on car expenses does not stop at haggling for the better price . There is more to it than meets the eye. Car expenses, in terms of maintenance, registration and insurance comes with the convenience and comfort your car provides. If you stay with a car to the very end, expect to bear the cost until it outlives its usefulness. (Curious to know the likely cost of owning a certain car a few years from now? You can run a [free VIN check](https://vincheck.info/check/vin-check.php) to know how much you should be prepared for.) Indeed, the price tag is just the tip of an iceberg.

In reality, you can expect more money-saving opportunities if you will look beyond the posted price. It will really help if in buying a car you should also consider the costs of maintaining it. Much of their car sob stories and financial drain will arise from misuse and mismanagement of daily car expenses. Daily expenses, which include maintenance, will always be with you each time you drive, whether or not you like it. Thus, it should always be on top of your head as they are going to matter the most in the long term. Continue reading below to get a better picture of managing your car expenses frugally. We will discuss in detail some of the best ways to maximize your spending and saving habits shortly.

**Down payment**

For most of us, we picture our ideal negotiation where we enter as nobody, walk through the process like a cakewalk, and leave the place a big winner. But this is best done when the interest rate is out of the equation and everything is decided by a one-time payment in the initial meeting. And you can only do this if you leave no room for installment or auto loan to enter into your agreement with the seller. Interest rates carry a lot of costs. If you can do away with it, or if you can put it down to a minimum, you take away much of the monthly cost from it. This way, you will save a lot of money from the purchase.

**Sales tax**

In some states, sales tax is a prerequisite for vehicle registration. In most instances, car owners will only be given a few days or weeks of grace period to register their vehicles after the purchase. Beyond that, a corresponding penalty may apply. The more days that passed without the registration being settled, the larger the penalty you may incur. Thus, the sooner you pay for a sales tax, the healthier it will be for your finances. A popular trick to reduce sales tax is to buy a car from a state with a low sales tax. But the practicality of the plan will depend on two things: (1) if the home state is going to honor the tax in lieu of home sales tax, (2) and if the cost of the trip would not be expensive.

**Registration fees**

Much like sales tax, a registration fee is also part of an inescapable process of making your car legit in most states. The perfect time to register a car is during the grace period provided by the DMV, which allows owners to drive their unregistered and untitled cars in a state without incurring any penalties for a limited time. Some states, however, will require a temporary driving permit first before being allowed to operate a car within a state. Late registration, or registering beyond the due date, may incur extra charges that may reflect badly on your records. This, in turn, can make future auto-related transactions hard and pricier. As they said, it is better safe than sorry. Pay your dues on time so you won’t have to deal with such consequences.

**Keeping your car smoke-free**

The reek of cigarette smoke lingers long after a lit cigarette is used up - taking up 2 days at most, according to most owners. Never underestimate the power of such smell to drive away potential buyers in a matter of seconds and drastically reduce the average prices of such cars by 7 - 9 percent. Selling a car in the private market is hard, but the job of convincing will be more challenging if the smell messes up with your prospective buyers’ senses. 

**Consider affordable but quality service providers**

Yes, as it stands, a car and its owner may be beholden to a typical manufacturer-approved dealership because of warranty. Contrary to popular belief, getting your car serviced by an independent dealership does not automatically void an existing warranty. The validity of the warranty will not be affected as long as the changes did not have any adverse effect on the components subject to the warranty. Thus, an independent service, if the price is good and quality is excellent, might deserve a shot for the thrifty. In fact, in one study, an average owner can save as much as $300 per year if they forego dealerships for an independent repair shop. But you can only be sure that the investment is worth it if you can determine the quality and reputation of the establishment. Make sure to look up the reviews online and check if an establishment has ASE certification.

**Low-priced insurance does not mean the best value** 

The auto insurance industry is big and has been with the world for generations. So, it won’t be surprising if the industry comprises big and small things as well as best and bad buys. Even so, if an insurance premium does not cover the necessities that make it invaluable, like coverage for bodily injury, property damage and death, it is no doubt a waste of money. What you should be looking for is the quality of the content of an insurance premium and how much it is going to cost you over a long period of time. You can compile a number of insurance premiums on a list to compare and find the best choice for your budget. Look for value, not the offered price.

**Third-party spares over branded originals**

Sometimes, the only significant difference between a branded component and a third-party one is simply a matter of aesthetic choice; the logos and a bunch of other engravings that scream of brand loyalty and tacit permission to bragging rights. Yet, these designs may command prices several dollars higher than those without. While these marks can assure you of topnotch quality, there are third-party items, or Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) spare parts that deserve a look. For a much lower price, you can enjoy the same, if not, superior quality items when compared to branded originals. Yet, again, a buyer must heed caution and observe due diligence with regards to items that interest them. Be sure to buy only from well-reputed sellers, as you don’t want to dedicate your money for flimsy items that will only last after a few days.

Aside from the aforementioned tips, there are other notable means to minimize your expenses. Being organized in your time blocks and following through with your plans with minimal aversions can reduce the redundant trips you may do. Bear in mind that the main point of minimizing expenses is to have spare cash for other pursuits and priorities that may be more important than car ownership and driving. Only pay for what you can afford on a car, without sacrificing more important priorities. One more thing: it consumes more resources to correct a bad outcome than prevent it. Following this logic, it would be wise to practice preventive maintenance to avoid problems that will require corrective measures. Not only is it more economical in a financial sense. It can also save you precious time, especially if it will take days for a car to be fixed and remain unavailable for use for a longer period of time.",1629968551.0

Total cost of ownership,1,p9d6qs,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/p9d6qs/total_cost_of_ownership/,8,"Heres a pretty great idea to save money over the long term. Assuming you can afford a slightly higher price today, it will pay for itself overtime, sometimes many times over. Here's a few examples.

Soap: Most people just buy the cheapest body wash at the store which is $2 for 15 oz, or $3 to $5 on a 16 ounce for a flavor or brand they like. Those are actually very expensive, because they last 3 weeks to 2 months. 

I found a soap that lasts me 10 months for 32 fluid ounces. It is called Dr Bronners soap. It costs $16 for 32 fluid ounces. Now now, I know what everybody is going to say. ""16 dollars for 32 ounces of soap? You call that cheap? I'm gonna go buy the cheap body wash. I'll show you Joe. I'll save a bunch of money buying cheap body wash, Dr Bronners is dumb""...

Before I say anything else, if you can't afford $16 for body wash, you can't afford $16 of body wash, the conversation is over. Go fix that. Get a second job, start a side hustle, cut money from somewhere else, go on a slightly lower phone plan, refinance your home for a lower interest rate. If you live in America or a first world country and are able to do so, make a little more money, ask for a raise, or cut your expenses slightly. 

Now I'll talk about the total cost of ownership.

Dr Bronners lasts me about 10 months at least. Possibly longer, this is my third 32 ounce soap in like 3 years. It costs $16 a bottle for 32 ounces.

Your $2 or $5 body wash lasts 3 weeks to 2 months. It costs $2 to $5 for 16 ounces. ""SeE tHeSe ChEaP sOaPs ArE bEtTeR dEaLs""... Now wait theres more.

1.) Dr bronners:

Lasts 10 months, costs $16 a bottle. 

Per month: $1.60

&#x200B;

2.) $2 body wash from DG:

3 weeks: $6 over 2 months, $3 a month.

1 month: $2 a month

2 months: $1 a month

&#x200B;

3.) $3 body wash

3 weeks: $9 over 2 months, $4.50 a month.

1 month: $3 a month.

2 months: $1.50 a month.

&#x200B;

4.) $5 body wash

3  weeks: $15 over 2 months, $7.50 a month.

1 month: $5 a month

2 months: $2.50 a month.

&#x200B;

When people say ""Buy the conventional body wash it's cheaper""... That is a CORRECT statement. How much cheaper over the long term? 60 cents at most per month?

It takes going to a $2 or $3 crap body wash and making that last 2 months to make them a better deal. You would have to be EXTREMELY broke for 60 cents at MOST to destroy you. If 60 cents destroys you... We are talking about soap that is toxic to yourself, to others, the environment, toxic to produce, tons of plastic waste from the 5 bottles you use in the 10 months.

Look, I'm Mr Cheapskate, but 60 cents at MOST per month isn't worth it at all.

Dr bronners in ALL other instances is cheaper to use month to month than any other body wash. Unless you can find a soap that lasts over a year, it is cheaper to buy, is still very natural soap with no artificial stuff in it, Dr Bronners remains the deal in everything. Do you want to use it for other things too? Great, buy the gallon dr bronners, it is about 45 cents per ounce.

Plus, all those other body washes are artificial garbage soaps that are made not grown, very toxic, they pollute the waterways, and much more bad stuff.

Dr Bronners soap is an 18 in 1 without the toxic chemicals, at least 70% of the ingredients are fair trade certified, they are a good company with good ambitions, not tested on animals, save for us, it doesnt damage the earth, it makes you smell good. And it is cheaper to own per month than MOST other body washes.

All you need for dr bronners to be effective is maybe 10 drops at most on a wet wash cloth, roughing up the wash cloth until it foams up, then wash away. I like citrus, they have almond, mint, unscented, and a few other natural smells. 

Use this total cost of ownership for paper plates (making waxed ones last a week or 2) bidets, vehicles, phones, anything you use on a daily basis. People need to get out of the ""Cheaper price cheaper product cheaper per ounce, more expensive price more expensive product more expensive per ounce"" mindset, if they are financially able to do so, and look at total cost to own said product. 

Here's another one. We used to buy paper plates once a month or once every 5 weeks. Our local store was out of stock of the unwaxed paper plates, so my mom bought the waxed ones with disgust, because understandably, it was more expensive, you got less plates, it was a bit painful just mentally, I get it. That was way back in February of this year, and we are still using that same stack of plates that she bought back then, they may last well into the new year. What's the secret? They are waxed, so we wipe them off and reuse them, and toss them away when they get too dirty to use. I used to use 20 paper plates every 2 weeks, now I use 1 to 2 every 2 weeks. That was my idea by the way. Oh to make them last even longer, you could put a towel on the paper plate and put the food on the towel, or I put a napkin over my plate which catches the crumbs and some liquid. My waxed paper plate looks 90% new and it's been a week since I have replaced it.",1629641681.0

I feel extremely fortunate. It’s hard to process how much money I can potentially make now. In 2019, I made $30k. 

I also have $35k in investments from saving. :)

In my last relationship, I lived with my girlfriend at the time. I'm kind of a doormat in relationships but I'm working on it.

Now that we are broken up, I moved in with my brother and my sister in law for less than half of the rent I was paying but I had to buy a new car. I bought a car well within my price range and it helps my mental health more than anything else so selling it to get a cheaper one isn't an option for me.

Just curious as to the title question \^

I'm 23 years old and I have saved over $66,000. I have around $35,000 in a TFSA and around $31,000 in a regular savings account. Keep in mind this is in Canadian dollars so roughly $52,500 USD.

I have no student loan debt. My rent is around $1,100 a month all inclusive. My credit card debt for food/groceries amounts to $200-400 per month. I rarely ever go to movies, restaurants, and I don't drink, so additional expenses are pretty low for me. Transportation is just public transportation or walking.

For added context I lived at home during university so I saved a lot of money on rent and food. I did move out after undergrad. I also don't have a car (yet) so I don't have any vehicle costs. I am on track to make around $40,000 this year and most of my expenses are on rent and food. I realize I'm very lucky to have had free rent and food during my years in undergrad, so definitely a large part of why I have this amount of money is due to my parents. I also worked part-time as a tutor during undergrad which went to pay my tuition.

2. Pay off student loans and one car (reduces monthly payments by about $700, that can then be used to pay off 2nd car much faster)
3. Pay off student loan & save the remainder or invest somehow.  

  
Ideally we want to boost how we save and paying off short term debt (cars/loans) lets us work on the house longer, but a 15yr mortgage is also really tempting! 

Help- what would you do and why??!

Note: We have a healthy savings with enough for about 8mo of bills paid 100% if needed so we don't feel the overwhelming need to put into savings, would rather use to further our debt reduction goals.",1628019576.0

403b as Roth?,7,onsv9e,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/onsv9e/403b_as_roth/,2,"
Hi all,

Apologies in advance if I’m overthinking this. 

I can contribute more than 0.5% (0.5 is mandatory) to a 403b and my employer will contribute 6%. The 403b can either be tax deferred or be ROTH. I think the limit is 18k per year. I’m not sure if limit is different for ROTH. 

I currently have a private ROTH through vanguard in which I have maxed out 6k per year for the last 3 years. 

Also have a teacher retirement system that automatically takes 5.5% until retirement where it becomes pension after 29 years.

My first question is.. if my salary is, say 48k, would it be better to tax defer the 403b? Or Roth? Tax season would definitely suck. Right now, however, no debt but no property. What would you do?

Spaving is essentially when you end up spending more in the belief that you are going to maximize your savings.

 I am sure most of you have done it when you add more items to your online cart to qualify for free shipping, or when you buy more food than you need just to spend less per unit.

 Well, I actually thought I was doing a good thing by taking those ""saving"" opportunities. It was when I became aware of this term that I started doing some research on how much more I spent per month on things like that. I realized that every month a spend anywhere from $15 to $30 extra by doing those. That comes out to about $360 yearly. Might not seem like a lot, but for someone who is trying to save that is a great beginning. 

I also found a way to save on my purchases without having to ""spave"". I kept sending the services I use every month to this site called Ubund.co, and they find more people that also use the same thing. Once they gather a decent group they can negotiate with the service provider for discounts. I am still waiting on some of those deals, but worth taking a look if you are trying to save and not spave.",1625861248.0

Treasury Bonds vs CDs?,1,ofpco2,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/ofpco2/treasury_bonds_vs_cds/,2,"Hello, savers.... I was wondering if there is anyone who has input on how I am planning to avoid depreciation of my saved money that will be used for a house down payment.

In today's interest rate environment, it's painful to see the rates offered to savers. I have been looking into CDs, but those rates are so low, it's almost not worth locking up my money. The highest rate I could find for a period I am comfortable with is .7% for 18 months with Marcus (the Goldman Sachs online consumer bank). I was just also looking at Treasury savings bonds, and series I bonds  have an introductory rate of 3.54%, and then the rate is recalculated based on inflation every 6 months after that. 

The drawback is a penalty of the last 3 months of interest if withdrawn between 1-5 years of issuance, but that still seems much better than the low CD rates out there even if I take that penalty say, after 18 months, mirroring my planned CD period.

Is there another drawback in this strategy I am missing? I don't see why everyone would just get series I bonds instead of CDs if my thoughts are correct.

Today, I've discovered the 52 Week Saving Challenge and I've decided to give it a go. I earn roughly $50 a week and I prefer to save 20% of my earnings. So my goal is to save about $10 a week. However, depending on my spending savings could drop to a $1.

My goal is to save at least $520 after 52 weeks. I'll post my progress here. So, I hope I'll be able to stick to this plan.",1625189500.0

Tips to pay off debt,28,o67876,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/o67876/tips_to_pay_off_debt/,4,"On the other side of saving money, there’s paying off debt, which is just as important. Otherwise, even if you’re saving money, it will still eventually have to go towards paying off what you owe. These are some tips I picked up personally that helped guide me in my own personal finance journey.

**Understand your debt.** Do this first. How much do you owe? What are your interest rates? Make a list of all your debts, their balances, and their rates as a starting point. Refer back to it when you get lost in all the numbers.

**Track your spending.** That cup of coffee from Starbucks every morning adds up without you realizing it. You need to know where your money is going. From there, you can look at your habits and begin cutting out the expenses you don’t need to free up some cash and pay off debt. Personally, [Ubund](https://www.ubund.co/?ubmid=129) was a great option for me and allowed me to manage my finances and accounts all on 1 platform. It even helped me reduce my monthly bill by giving me access to discounts on subscription services that I was already paying for.

You can read more on how it works [here](https://www.ubund.co/our-mission?ubmid=129). 

**Consider debt consolidation.** I know many people avoid this, but I wanted to include this just so you know the option is there. Depending on how much you owe, it might be worth it to look into debt consolidation to lower your interest. For instance, taking out 1 loan for $35,000 at an interest rate of 16% could save you much more money than 4 different loans totaling the same amount at an average rate of 22%.

You could also get a 0% interest credit card for a credit balance transfer if you can’t consolidate your debt. While there’s usually a 3% transfer fee you have to pay on the money you move to the second card, it might be a better option than paying a 24% interest rate on the original card.

Another option is taking out a personal loan to pay off your debt, which usually have lower interest rates as well.

Ultimately, the lower interest rate you have, the more money will be leftover to pay off your debt faster. There are different ways to go about it, but just be sure to do your research beforehand.

**Choose a payoff strategy.** In my personal opinion, it would be smarter to prioritize paying off higher interest rate debts because it can actually save you the most money. However, I’ve heard that paying off the lower rate debts first has more of a psychological benefit and keeps you motivated to continue working on debt payoffs for the long haul. All in all, approach it in the way that you think would be best for you.",1624429892.0

How I avoid accumulating bad debt as a student,7,nuxh2r,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/nuxh2r/how_i_avoid_accumulating_bad_debt_as_a_student/,2,"If you're like me, you might have struggled for a bit during the pandemic. It was this global disaster that spurred my own desire to educate myself and better handle my finances as a student. After some practice, I just wanted to share some of these key tips that helped with my own growth in my personal finance journey.

**Making a budget and actually sticking to it.** While some people prefer using regular spreadsheets, I like using budgeting apps due to convenience. Some apps that have worked well for me or others that I know include Mint, Buddy, and You Need A Budget (YNAB). The hardest part for me was actually following my budget rather than just creating one, so you might want to consider recruiting an accountability partner to help you start off, too. I had a couple of my friends put me in check whenever I started spending too excessively. 

**Distinguishing needs vs wants.** Put away your money for all your needs before considering any of your wants. Seriously. This was my biggest issue.

**Taking advantage of retirement accounts.** I opened a Roth IRA through my bank and aim to max out my contributions to it every year. Through my account, I’ve also used the money I stashed away to invest in index funds and ETFs so that I’m not only saving my money, but letting it grow on its own as well. On a similar note, I’ve recently opened up a Robinhood account because I wanted to learn more about and take advantage of the stock market, so hopefully that'll help me build some wealth as well. 

**Not paying more than you need to.** Think about the most cost efficient ways to go about a purchase. Can you DIY it? Can you recycle or reuse something you already have? Many businesses offer exclusive student discounts. Can you use a discount or coupon? If you’re not sure where you can cut costs, one of the places I started was signing up for Ubund for help. If you're like me, you probably pay a lot on monthly subscriptions for tech, education, media, and healthcare. Those subscriptions definitely add up, and Ubund has helped me a lot with reducing that. Basically, it leverages its community of users to negotiate discounts on your behalf to ultimately put money back in your pocket. The more people who join you, the more you get to save, and needless to say it's been a big help to me and my friends because we all win.

**Remember: money is a tool, not a goal.** Credit should be used to get you further in life, not just to buy things you can't afford. A good way to start building credit is to use it to pay for small things like grocery and gas so you're able to pay the bills on time. Then eventually, you can expand and adjust as you get a better feel for your spending habits. It’s not a matter of not spending, but rather just spending wisely.

You’re not alone during these tough times! I’m hoping my tips will serve as helpful reminders for you in your own personal finance journey. What are some good pieces of advice that you would recommend to a student?",1623130934.0

 Nowadays, e-commerce (online shopping) is an indispensable thing in each of our lives. In addition to bringing convenience, online shopping also saves time and costs for users. More specifically, during the COVID-19 pandemic when people need to limit communication and face-to-face contact, online shopping is a great solution for us. But how can we shop smartly online? How can you hunt for the best quality products at the best prices? And most importantly, how not to overspend while the pandemic is causing us to lose income gradually. Come with EventsCoupons to learn 7 smart online shopping tips to help you own the cheapest items and save the most.   
 **Tip #1: Always make a shopping list before you shop online.**

 If you do not want to get caught up in uncontrolled purchases and fall into an empty situation, you need to make a list of products to buy before embarking on the buying process, especially for online purchases. The more detailed the list of products to buy, the less time you spend shopping and the more money you save. Because you didn’t buy products that you don’t really need and will be abandoned later. Once you have a shopping list, you must only buy the products on this list. When buying online, customers are often easily caught in the trap of distributors because on shopping websites, they will always give suggestions about “similar products”, “related products” to encourage customers. buy more. So be a smart consumer and only buy the right products that you have pre-determined. 

 ***“If you buy things you don’t need, sooner or later you will have to sell things you need” – Warren Buffett*** 

 **Tip #2: Compare product prices from different sources.**

 Once you have a list of items to buy, the next thing to ensure a smart online purchase is to meticulously compare the price, quality, and origin of products on different e-commerce sites such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, BestBuy, or even Rakuten, Kakaku or Taobao.

In fact, it just takes a little time with a few mouse clicks and you’re done. Comparing prices helps you avoid the risk of buying a bad product with a “heavenly” price, especially during sales. Moreover, in the price comparison process, you can also learn more about the experiences and comments of people who have used the product, considering whether it really suits your needs or not. , shipping service, after-sales service?…Lots of useful information will be revealed if you take the time to learn.

 **Tip #3: Read product information and user reviews carefully.**

 Before shopping, please read the product information carefully. Then pick out the really well-known distributors who will deliver the product to you. And finally, read reviews from users as much as possible.

Usually, the reviews from people who have used the product are more valuable and accurate than the fancy advertising from the distributor. Therefore, to evaluate the quality of a product when buying online, read the reviews of people who have bought and used this product. Thus, you will have more grounds to decide whether to order this product or not?

 **Tip #4. Always use Coupon Codes, Voucher Codes, or Promo Codes for payment.**

 Currently, on holidays and special days of the year, online shopping websites or e-commerce sites often launch a series of promotions and discounts to attract the attention of buyers and increase sales. There are quite a few websites specializing in providing reputable discount codes that you can refer to for promotional information such as Amazon.com, RetailMeNot.com, Coupons.com, Savings.com,…etc. Take advantage of discount codes, gift vouchers to help save on shopping costs for you and your family to the maximum.

However, websites often launch so many promotions at the same time, it is difficult for you to keep track of them all. You can refer to [**Eventscoupons.com**](https://eventscoupons.com/) – one of the places that always provides the latest discount coupon codes updated daily by more than 500,000+ distributors worldwide.

Roughly $1000 goes to rent. I set aside in Wealthsimple accounts.  $1000 for retirement savings and $1000 to eventually buy a car. 

Im living with family so I can keep expenses very low. But I feel like I'm living paycheque to paycheque and it's very unsettling and boring. Any suggestions? ......",1622105335.0

Taking my savings out of Chile,2,nlks9u,SavingMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/nlks9u/taking_my_savings_out_of_chile/,3,"Hi Everyone!(My english is not that good so bear with me...)

TL;DR version: How can I invest in ETF being a foreigner.

Long version:

I live in Chile, I have my savings/investments separated on high-stupid risk (10%) and medium-low risk (90%).

Right now the situation on Chile doesn't look good. The left and extreme left won many of the Elections for Constitutional Convention, Mayors, Governors and Councilors. This made an impact on the value of the Chilean currency (CLP) so... Even if my savings grew through 2020 and 2021 the devaluation of CLP ruined everything and now I have less money than the original savings.

This is why I want to move all my medium-low savings to USD and put them into an ETF or related.

Some US friends recommended me [fidelity.com](https://fidelity.com) but it requires a social number to create an account (which I don't have, 2nd world problems), is there any other way to invest in ETF (or any other suggestion) being a foreigner?",1622045681.0

My understanding is, if they make the check out to me, it is treated as cashing out early, regardless of next steps. Any advice?

IRA - $6,000

I know currently we can save as much as we want into a savings account, but why are are limited for these accounts?

Can you suggest something for me to google to research because I can't be the first person to wonder about this - like what is the strategy for once you've hit these limits.

Is it like

2. exhaust Roth IRA
3. exhaust Regular IRA
