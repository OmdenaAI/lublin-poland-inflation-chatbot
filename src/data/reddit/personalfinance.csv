way behind on retirement,306,zvss1g,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvss1g/way_behind_on_retirement/,118,"Hello. 42m.  Got literally 6k in savings and that's it. No retirement. Later in the spring I'll have a chance to save because my child support obligations will be fulfilled.  My question is with the extra money, what's the best and quickest way to start saving for retirement?  I'm a 1099 contractor, so no company 401 k matches or anything, it's all on me. My wife is a W2 employee, but just recently got a steady job a few years ago and has started a 401k and has maybe a little more in savings. Our house is paid for as well as my truck, but she has a car note. Any suggestions are welcome.  We like to travel, and go on a few trips a year, nothing extravagant, mainly cheap airbnbs.

Edit.      I make around 38k to 42k a year before taxes",1672077785.0
I disputed unfamiliar Amazon charges as fraud on my credit card. Then I found out that a young relative accidentally used my card on their own account. How do I fix this?,387,zvgs8m,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvgs8m/i_disputed_unfamiliar_amazon_charges_as_fraud_on/,61,"***Update: I was able to contact Capital One and get someone who was able to answer my questions and fix things. They are going to reapply the charges and cancel the dispute with Amazon. This is the end of it. Thank you to everyone who provided helpful answers.***

This is a throwaway account. Also, I'm in the United States. 

I use virtual credit card numbers on the internet. I received notifications from my credit card app this week for unfamiliar Amazon purchases, one of which was hundreds of dollars. I immediately froze the card and reported the charges as fraud. The credit card company, Capital One, issued me a new physical card, disputed the charges with Amazon, and started an investigation. Capital One refunded me for those purchases.

I just found out that a young relative accidentally used that card on their Amazon account to order Christmas presents, thinking that they were using a different card. We found out when they got a notice from Amazon saying that there was a dispute with their account, and the charges matched the charges that I reported as fraud to Amazon. Their parents will be paying me back.

I found this out pretty late at night and called Capital One to call off the investigation and find out how to make it all go away. The investigation is called off (I think), but due to either a language barrier or because this situation was veering off of an obvious script they have for dealing with fraud, I could not figure out if that was the end. I do plan to call back Capital One in the morning so that I can hopefully get an agent that has a better understanding of English or can transfer me to a supervisor so that I can get better answers.

Should I expect anything to happen to this relative from Amazon, Capital One, or law enforcement? The relative's account is tied to a family Amazon Prime account, so will it affect that as well? 

I just want the whole thing to go away because the charges were an accident and it's being dealt with personally.",1672035545.0

40% flat increase on new job offer,90,zvlen9,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvlen9/40_flat_increase_on_new_job_offer/,46,"Hi all,

I am a consultant in Cyber Sec. I like my current company, they treat me relatively well and am overall quite happy with the pay, its just that my career goals aren't being met. I get frequent increases, bonuses, inflation etc. However, I am close to the ceiling.

I enjoy consulting, but due to career desires not being met, I applied and received an offer for an internal role at another company. With the new company, my career goals might be met a bit more closely, but not entirely. Furthermore, the offer is attractive as it comes with a 40% increase on my base pay (30% on total earnings).
 
The new offer is 40% flat increase, but it comes with no pay reviews, equity or bonuses.

Cancelled Flights: Options,29,zvrx4y,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvrx4y/cancelled_flights_options/,48,"Booked flights for Christmas from Albuquerque to Sacramento (layover in Phoenix, and connection thru Burbank). Made it to Burbank largely without incident. We stayed on the plane on the tarmac in Burbank, and were told by the First Officer we had an entire crew ready except a pilot.

After an hour wait, the disembarked us, and within about 30mins or so of waiting at the terminal, they cancelled our flight.

Waited in line to speak with a customer service rep, and were told the flights had all been cancelled due to lack of crew, but that no vouchers for hotels, rental cars, etc would be given to us due to the supervisor's order. We spoke with the supervisor, who confirmed the same thing .. she said higher-ups with the airline blamed all cancellations on weather, and denied any requests for vouchers.

Weather in Denver affected ""downstream"" flights nationwide beginning Friday 12/23, and have continued since then.

I had to pay for a hotel and a rental car on Christmas day, and drove the final leg of our trip (since the customer service rep said it was highly likely the next available flights would be cancelled as well).

What recourse do I have here? I plan to call the airline and try for at least a partial refund, since they failed to get us to our final destination, as well as coverage for hotel and rental car.

Should I threaten an attorney if they refuse? Would it be foolish to refuse the charge on my credit card? Thanks!",1672075486.0

But upon renewal in January, it appears my premium for the same exact same coverage is now $501/6mo (roughly $83/mo).

I called Geico about this, because nothing changed on my end (no accidents, tickets, violations or claims) and my previous rate this past July was actually cheaper than my original rate last January.  They mentioned that the cost of insurance has gone up due to factors in the car market, especially repairs which apparently have gotten costlier.

Goals are to buy land / house in the next 3-5 years; and maybe get a car within the next year.  

I'd like y'all's opinion on what I'm doing; this is my first time being anywhere near the 22% bracket, much less in spitting range of the 24% bracket. (I work in tech.)  

I have about $80k in student loans, all Direct Loans, subsidized and unsubsidized; as well I have a credit card debt of $5k that I recently incurred. It is on a 0% intro APR for the next 12 months; more about this later.  

The plan with the $80k student loans is to put them on an income-based repayment plan; which I was told costs < $400 per month. While after 10 years at my job, they'll be erased.  

I've created a budget, am moving into a new place in January; my rent is about 13% of my gross pay, while my entire monthly budget is \~ 20% ($1200). Oh, I'm paid bi-weekly as well.  

I contribute 6% to a pension, my employer matches 6.25%; then I put another 17% into a pre-tax 403b; the next step being to put \~28% ($1700) into an HYSA each month.  

Do this for the next four months to build up an emergency fund; afterwhich reduce the monthly contribution to just 16% ($1000) per month. Investing the difference into the pre-tax 403B, with the intent to max-out.  

About the credit card; I got a job at a local college where I can also finish my degree. But in order to do this, I had a $5k debt to pay to this college. They were being difficult and wanted me to pay $1000 per month!!!  

Instead, I got a credit card, $10k limit (had a co-signer); and put the educational debt onto a credit card with 0% APR for the first 12 months. In this time I plan to pay the minimum each month, while putting money into the HYSA to pay of the entirety one-month before it is due. (That way I don't have to worry about being late on the payment.)  

I recently checked via my credit union, my credit score is 700. 
 
I would very much like to buy a house / land in the next 3-5 years. 
 
I'm also starting a few side-gigs; structured under an LLC. The idea being to pay myself an hourly, put 25% into a SEP, and use the remainder to offset my monthly budget / HYSA contributions. That way I can max out my 403B, and eventually push money into a pre-tax 457.  

If I max out my pre-tax options, it pushes me \~$15k into the 12% bracket ... while I've made projections on how to reasonably attain the addition $27K needed per year to max-out the 403 & 457, via my side-gig. Which puts me $8k back into the 22% bracket; then I'd put 10% ($600) into a Roth and 24% ($1400) into the HYSA each month. The HYSA being the place to hold money for credit card payments and accessible savings, etc.   

At the end of every year, see what's been saved in HYSA, retain a principle and push the rest into something else? 
 
Or should I being putting money somewhere else if I want to be building up for a down-payment ?  

I'm in my late-thirties and this is my first time making an 'adult' salary; I'm seeing to be thoughtful about how I manage this new-found opportunity. Born an orphan-bastard, any help and suggestions would be appreciated because I don't have any one else to ask :/

Since then I’ve got 6 months emergency (~18K wife income only since I’ll always get paid by Uncle Sam) and I’ve just been putting all excess money 1-1.3K per month into a Schwab investment portfolio (currently around 20K) Reason for that is I don’t need the money and ideally in 4-6 years I’ll buy a car with some of it and keep going. Currently put 15% of both incomes into 401Ks, 200 a month in kids 529 and like I said any other saving/investment is just into that blanket managed portfolio. Take home total (after paying rent, taxes, retirement etc) is ~6250. Have no debt like I mentioned so just pay things like gas, food, insurance, etc but no cars or credit.

- Does the amount entered in Line 4b for deductions say X apply to reduce the projected annual-income by X or the biweekly paycheck income by X? 

I've seen amount in Line 4c (for extra-withholdings) apply for the biweekly paycheck directly but it seems for line 4b it applies to annual income based on the ""Deductions worksheet"" on page-3.

Say, someone gets $8k biweekly-paycheck.
 
By default with no-deductions or extra-withholdings amount withheld is about $1.6k.

- how does one reduce tax withheld to $500 or $0 per paycheck? What if they quit their job and get a one-time lump sum payment early in the year so the projected-annual-income wouldn't apply?

For this black knight card PSA up charged me $600 ($20 shipping to psa, $40 back to me) since they graded it so high, then I paid the guy at least $600-700 to open the packs to actually pull the black knight, then eBay charged me $830 in seller fees. Total cost $2,190. Total profit $4,110. Then a cool looking upcoming Disney game released called Disney Lorcana at a San Diego con, I don’t live near there and didn’t go so I bought the 6 card set from a reseller for $1125. Graded them through PSA, got upcharged $50-200 and resold some of the cards. Do I get to write off the price I purchased them from the reseller of $1125 and the grading/shipping fees and 13% eBay fees? 

I’ve had at least 6-8 situations where I’ve rush graded cards I thought would get a 10 and paid $150 per card and it comes back a 9 and I lost money reselling them for $30 or so. Do I get to write off that as a loss? 

5 days ago I opened a optic ufc hobby box and pulled a good card worth about $1,000-1,100 do I get to write off the cost of the hobby box $182 and eBay fees of 13%? So it would only be like $700 profit or?",1672073798.0
IRS Letter SSN Used for Employment,3,zvt9u6,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvt9u6/irs_letter_ssn_used_for_employment/,3,"Hi Everyone,

I received a rather disturbing letter from IRS stating that my SSN was used by someone to gain employment. The letter didn't provide any other details other than the fact that I should monitoring my earnings and taxes and place a ""fraud alert"" with one of the 3 credit bureaus (apparently, if you inform one, they are supposed to inform the other two).

Permanent life insurance: good idea?,0,zvx31c,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvx31c/permanent_life_insurance_good_idea/,6,"Recently talked to a financial advisor cuz I want to round out my financial plan and among other recommendations he gave us was the recommendation to get a permanent life insurance policy. I know there seems to be a general consensus that these plans aren’t usually useful, but I don’t know much about the subject and am curious if doing that is a good idea or not. The specifics for my situation are: I’m 26YO, currently making 54k a year for the next 3.5 years and after that will make 275-300k. About 300k in student loans (payments currently deferred), no other debt. My job has 401k but doesn’t match, currently putting in 10% per paycheck. I have a brokerage account with about 27k currently and 10k in savings. Not married yet but living with my partner who splits rent with me. Am able to put about 1k into savings per month. So, we spoke with this advisor who is a fiduciary who works on commissions. He recommended that 1. Switch my 401k to a Roth and max it out, 2: get term life insurance to cover my loans if I croak, 3. Keep putting in a small amount into brokerage account per year, 4. Apply for permanent life insurance, the policy he recommended would be $220 per month. To me, the first 3 seem like solid advice, the 4th I’m not sure. His reasoning is that the permanent life insurance will slowly accumulate a cash value that isn’t reliant on the market, so while it’s slow, it’s steady and reliable. We wouldn’t rely on it for our primary retirement savings, but that at the time of retirement, we’d have a few hundred thousand accumulated that we could take out tax free during down years in the market when our 401k and mutual fund accounts would take hits, so we wouldn’t have to “sell our stocks during down years that would have larger effects on our accounts ability to recover as much during the up years in the market”, in his words. Essentially it would just be a safety net. What do you guys think about this? It’s pretty expensive, but if it will truly be the best option down the road, I can afford to do it so I’ll do it.",1672089240.0

The groomers provide and maintain all their own kit that I didn't mention (Clippers, scissors, blades, insurance etc). 

Every Monday they transfer me all the earnings from the card machine and send me an invoice for the %40 that is their share. For an average example I can do 4 clients a day which pay £49.50 and I typically work 4 days a week.

**QUESTION**:

1. Am I classed as self employed even though I do not own the business and am not responsible for its success or failure, if so what is the correct self assessment form to fill out?
2. For my earnings do I include the %40 that I pay as rent or do I only use what I actually take home which is the %60
3. Do I need to register as self employed?
4. Do I get a tax relief/allowance from tools I buy to use at work or washing my work clothes and towels from work (these things only get used for work). I have been told by people to save my purchase receipts but wasn't sure if this was a thing?
5. If there are any recommendations for learning resources or ways to be more organised about all this and how to track it all please let me know!

Any reason to wait until 2023 to transfer my IRA?,1,zvupiq,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvupiq/any_reason_to_wait_until_2023_to_transfer_my_ira/,5,"I plan to transfer my IRA from Wells Fargo to Fidelity because the fees with WF are outrageous. My IRA contributions are already maxed out for the year within WF, but I'm trying to decide if I should move the accounts before or after January 1. A couple things to consider:

* On last year's statement for WF, it appears they charged me a quarterly fee on January 8, but I'm not sure if it's pro-rated, so this might not matter...
* If I move the account to Fidelity before 2023, I assume I will need to have two sets of tax documents for 2022?
* I have a Roth IRA (rolled over from an old account) and a Traditional IRA (to which I currently contribute), so I need to move both.

Wells Fargo sucks and has a $125 account closure fee PER ACCOUNT. It's still worth the move, but if I had to do it all over, I never would have used them. Reddit has been way more useful than our ""advisor"".

ETA: Went ahead and initiated the transfer -- took less than 15 minutes online. We'll see how long it takes Wells Fargo to drag their feet and whether it happens before or after the new year. ",1672082897.0

Desperately needing advice on how to deal with years of unfiled taxes and credit card debt,143,zv0uhq,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv0uhq/desperately_needing_advice_on_how_to_deal_with/,93,"I am making this post with a throwaway account, but I am desperate to find a solution to these problems that have been haunting me for years.  Some of this is my own personal stupidity, some is misfortune, and some of it is because I was misled, scammed or backstabbed, but it's causing me daily panic attacks now and affecting my health as I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and mild PTSD because of this.

To start with, the last year I filed taxes was 2014.

From 2015 to 2017, I didn't make enough money to owe taxes, but I didn't file because I lived in California and I had just enough to live on and couldn't afford to have health insurance, so I was stupidly worried about the penalties and not knowing how to deal with not being able to follow the new Obama Care mandatory health insurance.  I didn't think I would owe anything, so I just assumed if I didn't file the only problem would be not getting my usual refund.  Again, stupid, and a mistake, but I thought it wasn't too bad and I could find a way to deal with it when I really needed to since I wasn't technically going to owe tax.

Then in late 2017 my boss (let's call him E) died in a motorcycle accident, and I was his only employee who had access to most of his records.  He was a sole attorney and I had worked for him basically as a law assistant and personal assistant, and I was the only one who knew anything about his financial affairs, business and clients and current cases.

He had three kids and two houses, and a probate estate.  At that time, I had no way to pay my bills with him having died and was unsure what I was going to do about the business or the records.  I had been close with my boss, and I had once promised him that if something happened to him, I'd try to do right by him and his family because he had helped me in a tough situation.

Additionally, he had a wrongful death against the city he lived in for the motorcycle accident, because the cause of it was improperly protected and marked road maintenance which caused him to lose control and ram into a pole.

A former partner of his, who was also his father in law from a previous marriage and also an attorney himself, and the grandfather of 2 of his 3 kids (let's call him R) came to me and we talked about what to do.  

I didn't think it was fair the kids had lost their dad so suddenly, and I wanted to keep my promise, so when R asked me if I would stay on to help with the probate, wrongful death claim and continue to help him work the cases and the clients I was familiar with as his assistant with him as the new attorney of record, I agreed, because I had been E's assistant for basically 6 years and I was the only one who knew most of this stuff.  I also still needed the job and the money because losing my income suddenly was a problem.

R also told me that if the cases E was working before were left up in the air, they would go to the state bar and the kids would get very little from the attorney fees from them, but if I stayed to work them with R as the new attorney, the kids and estate would get much more from the attorney fees from the cases.  I was also the only one with the records to show how much E had worked on each case.

Here's the problem.  As a personal favor and a thank you for doing all of this for the family, R told me that he would pay me directly out of his own pocket, not as an employee, but as a gift that he would file with the IRS as part of a gift tax, and there would be no liability to me because he had a ""lifetime gift tax limit"" that would cover it.  He also wanted to pay me more than I was making before due to the all of the extra workload of the estate and probate.

I looked it up a little bit and I agreed because I trusted him, everyone benefited from the situation, it was a win-win-win all around, with the kids and probate getting more, me getting more even though I would have to work harder for a while, and when I looked it up I saw there was such a thing as someone filing a gift tax with a lifetime limit of several million (which we weren't even close to).  It all seemed to check out.  Also around this time, my girlfriend moved in with me to help with support during this.

I was named probate administrator and I continued to work with the court and work on the cases to help him out during 2018 and the first part of 2019.

To make a long story short, R was quite old, and close to retirement.  He had a health issue several months into dealing with all of this and he decided that he wanted to retire and move out of state and stop doing all of this work.  We had a bit of an argument because stopping the work would mean less money for the kids, and I would lose out on the additional money he'd been giving me which we agreed to at the beginning.

The probate and a good part of the cases were close being done around mid to late 2019.

That is when R decided that he wasn't going to do the gift thing because he was paying all of the taxes on it, and with his retirement, he was okay with backstabbing me and keeping the money because he 'needed it for himself and his health issues' so of course he decided after the fact that he would issue me a 1099 form for 2018 and later for 2019.

My 1099 for 2018 was about $64,000 and for 2019 about $25,000.   I didn't find out about this until the first part of 2020.  I had some money saved up from what I was making, but nowhere near enough to pay taxes on that, plus I still had my back taxes filing issues from 2015-2017, and no tax information at all from 2017 because of my boss' death and issues with the probate accountant.

I was at a complete loss at what to do, and then the pandemic hit and everything was chaos and stress.  I managed to get by for a little bit on the savings I had plus my fiancee's retail job, plus some money from stock investments I'd had jointly with my mom, plus statutory probate administrator fees left over from the end of the probate.

To downsize and minimize expenses, my fiancee and I moved from California to her mom's house in Texas.  The move was expensive, but I thought not having to pay rent for a while would be worth a bit more money up front so we did it.  Getting a job during the pandemic in 2020 was next to impossible, so we used what we already had plus credit cards, plus the pandemic assistance to get by.

Then comes part two.  Some people may be familiar with what happened in the financial markets in late 2020 and early 2021, when there was a massive boom and huge pump into the market.  

To make a long story short because this could be a whole section in its own, I managed to hit a massive string of luck on my small stock investments and trades.  During 2021, my account which started around $12,000 was as high as $2.1 million.

This is where my full on stupidity kicks in.  I freely admit that I had no idea how to even begin to handle that kind of money, I've never been more than lower middle class at best much less ""rich"" and I was in such a massive euphoria along with so many others during that time, that I thought it would go on forever.  

I pulled some money to pay down credit cards, pay some expenses and pay my mom her share of the investments, and then, in a massive fit of personal stupidity, I put the rest right back into the market because I was convinced that I was some genius investor and I would just continue making money.

I still didn't know how to even begin to deal with the back taxes and the 1099 and lies by R that should never have been filed, because I was scared shitless of the IRS, especially now that I had completely lucked into money (and I now know that it was complete luck).

To make a long story short again, most people know that the market has tumbled like crazy since the middle to end of 2021.  When I got the money, through a combination of stupidly living off of it because I thought I would be able to forever, and the market downturn that has been happening, and stupid investments, I had lost nearly all of it.  I had been desperately keeping money in the brokerage in denial thinking that things would have to turn around eventually, and instead used credit cards in the interim to pay bills.  We had also moved out into a place of our own again because I thought I had the money to be able to afford it, and no foresight or planning in how to use or what to do with that money.

So here's my current situation:

My brokerage account is at $30,000.
I have about $4,000 in my bank account and maybe $10,000 worth of stuff that I could reasonably liquidate in any decent time frame.

I don't have a job but I have just managed to snap out of whatever hope I was still holding onto for a market rebound, and have started applying for law jobs again and I just applied for door dash in the meantime.

My fiancee has a $2100 a month remote job working from home and hope to be able to do that much with door dash in the meantime until I can get a law job that will hopefully pay around $3000-4000 a month.

I have $41,000 in credit card debt.
I owe about $8,000 on a car that is maybe worth about $18-20k so there is at least some possible equity there.

I just went into the IRS website and pulled my account information.

The last year I filed was 2014.

I don't owe tax from 2015-2017 but haven't filed returns.
I owe self-employment/1099 taxes for 2018 on about $64,000 plus interest and penalties and CA state tax plus interest and penalties (I don't know what this is because I can't get into the CA tax website due to not filing returns)
I owe self-employment/1099 taxes for 2019 on $25,000 plus interest and penalties and CA state tax plus interest and penalties.
I owe nothing for 2020 because nothing was filed and I didn't realize stock gains in 2021. 
I owe short term gains of $113,000 in 2021 plus interest and penalties from October 2022 (because I filed an extension to file a return for 2021 but never filed that).

My monthly bills until my lease is up in April are about $5000 including rent, utilities, food, phone, internet, minimum credit card payments, etc.

I don't have a job right now but I am applying to everything.

So what was once a bit of shortsighted stupidity, was compounded by being backstabbed by R who advised me in a certain way and then backtracked, and then further compounded by mismanaging an unexpected insane windfall of money and then being in denial about it continuing to go up or recovering after losses.

I no longer know what to do, so I am desperately seeking help and advice because I feel like I am at the limit of my anxiety.",1671984443.0

I make $40,669 a year and would like to set up my elections to contribute 81% of my paychecks so that I can have about $16k in my 2023 401k before I start being a stay at home mom in July.

However, when I put into the system that I make $40,669 a year, it won't let me increase my contribution to more then 50.4% for a total of $10,250 (because over a year that totals to $20,500)

When I lie to the system and tell it that I make only $20,344 a year, I can set it to contribute 81% of my paycheck like I would like. However, I'm not sure if John Hancock deducts from my paycheck based off solely the percentage (meaning it would take out 81% of my $40,669 paychecks for a total of about $16k by mid year) or whether it deducts a dollar amount each month based off ( $20,344 / 12 ) \* .81, which would result in only $8239.32 being inserted by mid year.

I just got into a grad program that my company will reimburse me for. Can I use a 529 to pay the upfront costs? 

I currently don’t have a 529 and do not need to pay my tuition until May. I’m getting a bonus in February and was thinking of using some of that to front for the bill. What’s the most efficient way to handle this? Any thoughts are appreciated!

Costs are about $12-13k per year with work reimbursing $10k as long as I get a “B or better” in each class.

it gets tight after paying the mortgage, bills, and groceries. we’ve recently gotten a LOT better at not spending so frivolously so we have more of a cushion month to month, but we aren’t sure what to do with our newly freed up funds left over from this.

should we aggressively pay down the debt first, or should we make payments on the cards slightly above minimum (while not using them) and the personal loan and start saving our leftovers to establish an emergency fund?",1672044883.0

I had a bit of cash sitting in a traditional IRA account that I requested to rollover into a Roth. Two questions on tax treatment on this rollover to a Backdoor Roth:  
1. If I deposited those funds in 2021, will there be any issue with them being rolled over in 2022? No gains have occurred given the market conditions right now (negative return in 2022 and since I deposited)  
2. I'm doing this through Wealthfront, what happens if my backdoor conversion is delayed until first day or so of January? I assume that amount of rollover will then count towards 2023?

I’ve recently found a Collections on my credit report. I ignored something I could’ve taken care of and it’s now come back to bite me. I couldn’t pay the debt in December 2019 and once the Pandemic came, it became much less of a priority. The collections was brought on to my credit report in July 2022. My credit score has dropped to around 640, I make 55-60k per year, and I don’t have other infractions. 

I make enough money to pay it off now but damage has been done. The original amount was $1100 but the collections is $1600. 

My plan is to try to negotiate a pay-to-delete myself with the Collections company. I have a few questions if anyone can help, I’d greatly appreciate it. 

I assume that paying it all in one would be beneficial to the collections people and they’d be open to removing it from my record. What are my chances there? Will my credit improve if they can remove it? It’s better to pay it all off in one than multiple payments, right? 

I could pay it all at once but it would make things a little tight for me, should I look into a personal loan? Would that continue to hurt my credit?

Anyway I just calculated the full value at just over $1400. Only about half of them are mature, the others are worth between $70 and $95. Is it worth it to let them fully mature or should I cash them out and invest in something else? Will I have to pay taxes on them if I put them in a Roth IRA? I was thinking about opening one anyway and this seems like the perfect thing to start off with considering it's basically $1400 that I didn't know I had.

Beginning my life and I could use some advice on how to save my money - I'm overwhelmed,2,zvfok0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvfok0/beginning_my_life_and_i_could_use_some_advice_on/,4,"I'm in my low 20s. I just graduated college and got an SWE job making 87.k a year with other bonuses (e.g., I received a 25k sign on bonus and then there are yearly bonuses worth 8k that I'll receive in the future. I did have to spend a decent portion of this bonus on relocation and furniture.) I live in an urban area but the cost of living is really nice. I have a girlfriend but she is still in college, and I really don't want to have kids in the future. At most, maybe one?

Each paycheck I receive is roughly \~2400 after tax, insurance costs, and 401k contributions. I've opened a 401k with my employer who does a 167% match on the first 6% of my contributions. I am currently just putting in 6% but I have read that I should probably increase this. I also hear that opening a Fidelity Roth IRA is a good idea, but I hear that there are limitations on who can open one. 

I have no debt other than some small student loans < 10k which might be cleared entirely via Biden's plan. If not, my parents are paying this off for me. 

I have about 20k in the bank right now. My plan is to take a chunk of this out (probably 8k?) and create an emergency fund account. The rest I want to go to saving a house. I have a car currently that is paid off and only has 50k miles on it, so it'll be around for a while. 

Here is a plan I've drawn up on how to allocate my **monthly** earnings. Should I look at all into investing in the S&P 500? I've heard good things about that, but I don't want to jump into anything like that without better knowledge. Please critique what I have drawn here. 

Essential expenses (50%): Rent, Electricity, Phone, Internet, Insurance, Gym. All of this adds up to roughly $1950. Most of my insurance is provided through work; however, I pay for auto, renters, and liability insurance. 

Retirement Savings (15%): Increase 401k contribution and open Roth IRA such that 15% of my income is being fed to these savings accounts. 

House fund (%10): Emergency fund is already fulfilled at 8k (should I keep feeding into this? how do you recommend I proceed with funding both my house savings and emergyency fund?) so contribute 10% to my house fund. Renting blows. 

Whatever else (%25): Food, gas, entertainment, and whatever else.

Drastic increase in income - How to approach retirement options (Fidelity),1,zvgg3a,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvgg3a/drastic_increase_in_income_how_to_approach/,3,"Hi PF,

I've been a lurker for years, so I'm excited to have something to post. Quick stats: 31 years old, in a relationship (not living together), childfree (and do not want them), no student loans or car loan (paid off both by end of 2020; car is 2019 and a solid make/model with good gas mileage), working remote, San Diego, hope to move out and live in an apt with no roommates by summer 2023, HYSA with: EF of 10K, savings of 15K, prepped for rent/moving out with 5K, accurate sinking fund for car stuff (repairs, registration, insurance), a ""self celebration"" fund (treat yo self), and a travel fund (1K...I traveled a bit this year). I have paused adding (via regular deposits) to my EF and rent/move out prep because I feel solid with those...if anything I may bump EF to 15K or 20K when I move out and the rent/move out one to 8K to account for buying furniture. After moving out, the rent one will becoming a sinking fund with about a month or two of rent ready to go at all times. Based on my past salary, I currently put $650 in my savings, $100 in the car stuff, $200 in travel, $50 in self celebration, and $150 in Roth IRA per paycheck. 

 I recently got a new job that came with a significant increase in income; I've reviewed some PF content on retirement and investing, and have budgeted for many years, but I'm unsure in this next step for finances, especially retirement. 

My last job used Fidelity and allowed people to have a 401K, 403b, and a 457b. I did the 401K option, and chose to put 100% of my investment contributions in the the Target Date 2055 option that had an expense ratio of 0.03%. While I made crap money, the benefits were solid and I was required to put in 7% and my employer put in 8%, with 100% of the money vested from day 1.

Top Holdings:
UC Domestic Equity Index Fund 44.42%
UC International Equity Index Fund 27.93%
UC Long Duration Fund 9.87%
UC Emerging Markets Equity Fund 9.05%
UC Domestic Small Cap Equity Fund 8.73%

The amount in the account is currently around ~$40K (depending on how the market is doing). I also have a Roth IRA (Vanguard) with about ~11K in it. 

My new job has a salary of 130K, which is a lot more than I'm used to (55k)! I'd like to set myself up for retirement success, without going overboard. For me this looks like playing a littleeee bit of retirement catch up, and contributing a solid amount now as my expenses are lower(ish), having a bit of lifestyle inflation (I want to move out and live on my own...been there, done that with roommates. No thanks unless with S/O in the future), traveling more, and hopefully owning a home one day. 

My health+dental+vision insurance is about $260/mo, but I get $150/mo in reimbursements from my work for internet + gym. When I move out, I plan to spend about ~$1500 -1700 in rent + probably ~$150/mo in utilities, about ~$500/mo in food (groceries + eating out), and I plan to increase my travel sinking fund to $300-350/paycheck and my ""self celebration"" to maybe ~$100/paycheck. With my new income, I don't think I'm eligible to contribute to my Vanguard Roth IRA...is this correct?

My new job ALSO uses Fidelity (yay!); I can choose a traditional 401K and/or a Roth 401K. My contribution + employer contribution is 100% invested from Day 1. I currently have 5% in both options (so 10% total...for now!); my employer contributes 50% matching on the first 6% of my contributions. 

For the time being, I selected the Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) which has an expense ratio of 0.015%. Would this be the best option for me?

Another option I almost considered was the T. Rowe Price Retirement 2055 Fund (TRRNX) but that has an expense ratio of 0.64%. It's asset class is ""blended investments"" vs. stock investments of FXAIX. 

Any help/insight/tips/etc. is appreciated! In terms of additional savings in my HYSA, I will probably start a housing fund. Not sure how much I will put into it yet, but I want to figure out retirement first.

I graduated last year with a balance of $28k and have been making large payments to knock it down since I thought the interest would unfreeze which was at 6.9% for the highest one in the group of loans which is now gone. Now the highest interest rate in my group of student loans is 4.45% when they unfreeze. My other loan was a personal loan for $25k that I pulled out because I was moving for work out of college and needed money for expenses. I also used this loan to take over the 4.9% interest rate on the $15k I still owed on my car. This loan has an interest rate of 2.99% and is currently at $20k after making the planned monthly payments on it of $400. My question is if I should continue to knock down these loans like this or if I should more aggressively pay off the loan that currently has a higher interest rate? Right now I was planning on continuing to pay off the rest of my student loans by putting $1k a month toward them and continue to make the planned payments toward my personal loan. For reference I make about $80k a year and have about $2k of expenses a month before my loans. Thanks for the advice!,1672033149.0
Make quarterly tax payments? Raised SSA and interest income,7,zv486q,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv486q/make_quarterly_tax_payments_raised_ssa_and/,5,"Asking for my mom, who lives in NJ (which has a state income tax); single filing (she is widowed). In prior years the SSA income was not very high and she did not withhold federal tax (no way to withhold state tax from SSA in any case). 

- So with COL adjustment this year, she would have $30k in annual income. 
- My dad’s passing 2 years ago left her some funds that she has now in taxable accounts (savings/CDs), and in 2023 interest rates are high, so we estimate she’d have $18-19k in interest income. Banks don’t do state/federal withholding for normal interest (unless there is a way to ask for that)

My questions are:
- would it be advisable to make quarterly federal and state tax payments, and if so, is it needed to pay every quarter (the interest income is end of year only)

- if we ask social security to withhold federal tax, what can we do for the state tax?

Roth IRA Recharacterized to Traditional. Next step for backdoor?,4,zv7of9,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv7of9/roth_ira_recharacterized_to_traditional_next_step/,7,"Hello everyone,

I made a contribution to my Roth IRA in January of 2022 (as 2022's contribution) of $6,000 and now realize that at the end of the year I am over the income limits to contribute to a Roth IRA directly as MFJ. I have requested a recharacterization of this amount with Fidelity to a traditional IRA (currently processing).

  
Now here are my question(s). I want to convert this amount back into the Roth IRA so that all of this money is in the Roth IRA (with $0 in the Traditional IRA).

1) What is the terminology to transfer the amount back to the Roth IRA from my recharacterized tIRA? Conversion from tIRA to rIRA, correct?

2) Do I have to do this before December 31?

3) Is it possible to use this recharacterized amount to offset tax dollars this year on my 2022 tax return, and then move the amount back into the Roth IRA in 2023 (and pay that tax on the 2023 return instead)?

Questions on setting up Solo 401K,0,zvfbfs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zvfbfs/questions_on_setting_up_solo_401k/,3,"I am 55. Earlier this year, I sold most of the assets of my very small S corporation, and my 3 employees took positions w/ the assets' buyer, leaving me as the only employee of my business. I changed the nature of the existing business into home consulting work and writing etc. rather than through a storefront. I did NOT have a 401K set up for any employees or myself.

I am trying to figure out setting up a solo 401K for myself now I am able to. I would like to make it for 2022, after I went to just myself. I have some questions that were not able to be answered satisfactorily/consistently by several tax professionals I’ve consulted, misc. website references, Fidelity agents, or by the IRS website. Historically I’ve run payroll myself through QuickBooks and did my own business bookkeeping (leaving Federal tax prep to a pro but the pro doesn’t really work much with solo 401k plans so he can’t help me).

1. I understand that since I had employees through April 2022, I can effect my solo plan on a date after that and still have it start in 2022. I just wanted to confirm that there won’t be confusion because of the 2022 W2’s I generate? 
2. I understand I can include in what I defer, the salary I received earlier in the year before the employees left, correct? Or, do I have to disregard my salary, for deferment purposes, earlier on in the year before I went 'solo'?
3. I do still have a 1099 consultant. Is this considered an employee as regards to jeopardizing the solo 401K?
4. My annual W2 salary had been slightly less than the minimum contribution at that point, can I give myself a 2022 raise to cover the amount of the maximum contribution including the catchup after 50 part? I thought I found somewhere in the IRS documents that my tax deferment amount is limited by the average of the last 3 years' compensation (up to the limit)… but unclear if the comments were referring to the solo401K or some other deferment type so I wanted to confirm.
5. I have seen several %’s floating around of what my corporation can contribute ’non-electively' —  20% of my contribution as per the IRS directions I think? I see 25%  elsewhere on solo 401K employer contributions so I wanted to be correct.
6. Need a little help in defining “total compensation” on the amount that can be tax deferred… is this the value of the W2 salary before deductions (up to the limit)? Or what is left on the paycheck after all deductions are removed? Example: $20K is salary, $18K is net paycheck total is after withholding, medicare/FICA removed. Is the tax-deferred limit $20K or $18K? If it's based on the gross salary before the deductions, I will have a follow-up question on this from an IRS941 form perspective on Quickbooks.
7. On the application form, there is an option to sync this with social security or not. Most people chose ‘or not’ according to the Fidelity agent and he told me it would be up to a tax advisor’s choice. Do you know reasons off the top of your head why it would be advantageous and what it means?

Confused about why my 401k contributions are less than what I expect based on percentage elected.,8,zv43xm,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv43xm/confused_about_why_my_401k_contributions_are_less/,6,"Hi all,

About the last 6 months I increased my contribution to 20% from 17%, matching is 5%. My biweekly income can vary quite a bit due to call, overtime, shift differential, deciding to not fill up hours short with PTO. For example, my last paycheck I grossed 3680.22. My 401k contribution was 646.33. This is 17.56%. My employer's contribution was 161.58 (4.39%). 

Previous paycheck. 4111.08, 401k contribution 645.71 (15.7%), match 161.58 (3.93%). 

Please make it make sense. I don't really know who to turn to. Honestly, some of the calculations on our checks make no sense. For example, my rate for overtime pay is 56.80 (base pay is 47.25, so ??) and my rate for ""call back pay worked"" is 70.88. Anyone else a nurse that has confusing pay rates/checks like this too?? I am told that if i calculate it it is correct, and yeah its usually around what I expect based on hours worked but it still doesn't make sense to me. Overtime and call back pay I have been told/understand are both paid at a 1.5 your base pay rate. 

Mainly I am frustrated that I am trying to maximize my contributions and I am short by 4500 this year. First world problems I know, and I can just increase by contribution to 25% or whatever to make it get to the maximum amount, but it should just make sense!!!! My gross pay this year was 112k, so having between 17-20% this year should have gotten me pretty dang close to the maximum allowed of 20500.",1671994584.0

Both of us work in healthcare. SO pursued higher education and stopped working for about 1.5 years. She finished school a year ago and started a new job at the beginning of this year. We had a baby in the middle of this year and she took several weeks of maternity leave. This means the only debt we have is some hospital bills, school loans and the mortgage. With her returning to work from leave, I stepped down from full time to per diem / PRN for the sake of childcare.  
  
Since leaving previous job, her work had a 403b through Fidelity which was then rolled over into a traditional IRA (just checked and saw a huge loss but she never touched it since the rollover). She has had something else setup with TIAA for a while but I’m unable to access it at hand (wish she would transfer it over to Vanguard for simplicity sake).  
  
New job has a 401k plan but doesn’t offer match. I looked at the flow chart primer but got a little tripped on where things should go. From what I understood for the order of things:  
  
- consider paying off school loan snowball/avalanche 
- max IRA
- 15% to 401k
- max HSA
- max 529
- max rest of 401k (not happening lol)  
  
Do I have that order of priorities right? 
  
I guess I should state my stance in all this too. I max out Roth IRA, match the match for 403b, and have a brokerage account ($100 every 2 weeks).

Now, we’re still living comfortably but actually close to net zero.

I have 20k in a bank account (savings) at Chase and I just accepted a job offer that is 70k/yr gross income with great Healthcare benefits and a 401K that they will contribute 6-9% to each year. It is embarrassing to me that I got this far with such a limited understanding of money management. 

So basically, I am looking for a book that is pretty comprehensive across all things personal finance. It would be nice for it to have big part dedicated to savings/401k/retirement/IRAs/investing.",1671993965.0

I have offers for either vehicle at MSRP.  This would only be used for commuting. I have a pre-approval and there are no add-ons. Pre-approval is at 3% and lease residual value for the Corolla is 49.8%. (Dealers did not want to disclose Camry Residual). 

Most of my friends and family are telling me to lease for 36 months, 15,000 miles and return it after the lease because it's a lot of miles to be putting on the car given my commute. Then they recommend buying a car once I have enough to buy something cash.

If I were to come into possession of another 50k through cashing out investments, would it make more sense to pay off the student loan or put it towards the house?

One school of thought would be to pay off the student loan since it has the smallest balance and highest rate (8.5% SL compared to hypothetical 6% mortgage). I have calculated that by paying off $50k of student loans, I would be saving $38.5k in lifetime interest. On the other hand, putting an extra 50k down on the house saves me about $58k in lifetime interest and lowers my monthly payment by $300/mo.

First time home buyer advice for a befuddled dad,0,zv5y10,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv5y10/first_time_home_buyer_advice_for_a_befuddled_dad/,4,"Sup friends? I hope you all had a less stressful holiday season than I did. I was trying to buy a house right before Christmas (so smart, I know) and let me tell you, it was a not fun. As a hopeful first-time home buyer, single income husband, and dad in my 30s, I found the process to be a total headache. 

It felt like I needed a PhD in finance just to understand it all, and I felt rushed by lenders and realtors (understandable since I was making them work days before Christmas).

Despite being pre-approved and bringing in a modestly decent income from my job and side hustle (around $85k per year), it was hard as hell to estimate what the final mortgage would be. We ended up with a estimate from the lender of around $1,600 per month (when on Zillow it had estimated 1,150!) 

We make too much to qualify for any sorts of programs to help with the down payment or closing cost, but We still felt like we had the budget for it, so we were getting ready to make an offer on a beautiful two-story, four bedroom, two and a half bathroom house in the Midwest for $198k on Christmas Eve. 

But then we discovered undisclosed foundation issues that would cost around $10k to $20k to fix. It was just too much to figure out before the holidays… I’m no expert on repairs and I didn’t want to blow my entire savings on a down payments and repairs. 

I really do want to buy a house eventually, because our current rental is only 800 sq ft and it's driving us bonkers with a tiny son running around and me working from home. 

But buying a house feels like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. I'm an extremely hard worker who is trying my best to provide for my family, but my biggest fear is making a bad decision and ruining our financial future.

Does anyone have any advice for someone completely new to all this? I could really use some guidance from someone with experience. 

Thanks in advance,

- A dad who just want to do his best for his Fam.",1672000132.0
Making sure I understand the wash-sale rule,0,zv5ww4,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv5ww4/making_sure_i_understand_the_washsale_rule/,2,"So my situation is roughly as follows.

I have two accounts:

1. A taxable account holding \~50 shares of VTI with a \~$1,500 loss
2. A Roth IRA with \~11 shares of VTI, 6 of which were purchased in the last 30 days

&#x200B;

I would like to harvest the losses in my taxable account by selling the entire VTI position. My understanding is this would apply a wash sale to the cost bases of the 6 shares I have bought in the last 30 days. But as long as I don't buy anymore VTI for the next 30 days I will be able to harvest the lost on the remaining 44 shares. Is that correct?

If it is not correct would the right way to solve this be to just sell my position of VTI in both accounts and wait for 30 days to buy again? This is my first time tax loss harvesting while having to deal with this type of setup so any help is appreciated",1672000030.0

As far as I can tell there are no fees.

The currency here fluctuates compared to USD, but as far as I can tell, not that much. The difference between the high and low this year represents a drop of about 5.5% vs USD (it has since recovered and is at a 3% drop YTD compared to USD currently), but even if you invested at the peak and cashed out at the worst time that would still come out to like a 13% annual gain (unless I’m doing the numbers wrong).

So yeah, I’m not sure if the confidence/perceived risk is just really bad or if there’s something major I’m missing.

I owe roughly 140$ a month.

I've already paid $1,200 but of that, 240$ has been interest. This doesn't add up.

$6,500 loan at 10.49% interest over 5 years is a total of $8,400.   
8,400 - 6,500 = 1,900 worth of interest.   
1,900 / 60 = 31.66 in monthly interest.

I was not given any receipts. The bar is refusing to provide receipts, or a list of what I bought, stating that bars in their country do not provide them, which is nonsense of course. I have asked them repeatedly and they have flat out refused. (FYI it is one of those shady bars, they are refusing to say the name of it and the exact location - it is not Googleable)

I paid for everything in five instalments using my credit cards and debit cards and entering the pin. I signed no receipts (and no receipts were given to me to sign when I was there). 

They are now trying to convince me to wire me some of the money back to me because if this goes to the police or through their local courts it will take forever and I won’t get anything. And because they say they have me on CCTV entering the pin for the payments, I won’t win any dispute through my banks. 

I have now disputed the amount spent on my credit cards and it is being investigated, they have taken that money away from the statement. However the rest of the amount was on my debit cards (including one MasterCard Debit card). What are the chances of getting all this money back?

Because my grandfather has a limited income and does not have to file taxes (?) he and my father determined that he should receive 16k as a lump sum and leave the remaining 18k in. This has already occurred.

My father and I are working to fill out a form for my grandfather to receive the rest of the annuity (18k). He would like to receive equal payments over 5 years and then have the account closed. We are stuck on which option will do that on the form we are filling out:

1) lifetime income 
2) lifetime income with a guarantee period of (5-30) years 
3) lifetime income with cash refund 
4) lifetime income for two

It's worth noting that I already contribute \~$5000 dollars/year to the MBDR, so this is for additional money.

* Pros
   * Not all employers offer this, so good to seize opportunity when possible
   * Principal can be withdrawn without penalty
* Cons
   * May incur 10% penalty on top of capital gains taxes if above principal
   * Early withdrawal will interfere with giant compound interest in future - **bigger concern**

Taxable

* Pros
   * More liquid in the sense *everything* can be withdrawn without penalty
   * Will not disrupt retirement compounding
* Cons
   * Capital gains tax
   * May be a waste of MBDR since I could be putting money in there instead while it lasts

Pay off my mortgage or invest,13,zumtdu,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zumtdu/pay_off_my_mortgage_or_invest/,76,"I’m new to this sub, so forgive me if this subject is already beat to death.

My wife and I don’t quite see eye to eye on the mortgage. For a while, we followed her approach and paid extra to the mortgage in an effort to pay it off early. I didn’t like tying all that money up in equity. Eventually we compromised and invested the extra principal in a mutual fund with the plan to pay off the mortgage when we reached the break even point.

We’re now about year out from the break even point and I’m wondering about the wisdom of our plan. Sure, it would be nice to not have a mortgage, but would it be more prudent to keep the funds invested? We have a 3.5 rate on the mortgage and we’ll owe about 65K at the break even point. The only variable I don’t know is what our investment is earning (I’m bad at tracking this, but it’s in a relatively safe mutual fund).

I understand the stock market averages over 3.5%. Given our circumstance, and my lax tracking of the mutual fund, would it be better to just pay off the mortgage, or is there some wise insight that could help me convince the wife to keep the funds invested?",1671928729.0

Which online brokerage would be best for no load mutual funds and free stock trades and mutual fund trades (in case I wanted to gamble some money trying to play the market)? Fidelity? Vanguard? Schwab? TD Ameritrade? eTrade?

Realistically, much of it would probably be in low fee index funds such as the FZROX and VTSAX.

If I were an ""active"" investor, would there be any downsides to doing something like purchasing 100 shares of VTSAX (or VTI-ETF) at $100 ($10k value), selling it at $105 ($10.5k) after a market spike, waiting for it to drop back to $100, and then purchasing 105 shares at $100?

(Probably no, seems like a terrible idea.)",0,zv5mod,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zv5mod/us_are_there_any_banks_or_pseudobanks_that_give/,6,"I've seen a lot of banks (or bankish institutions) with various wacky rewards programs. **Are there any that offer some kind of rewards on rent paid by check?**

Same question for Zelle payments funded by a bank account (not debit card).

**I strongly suspect that the answer is no**, for the following reasons:

* Giving rewards on rent seems extremely abusable; there are a lot of small landlords, it's hard to prove what a check is for, and rent can be a big expense (especially if you also run your business out of your house, etc).
* I think one reason that you can get rewards on credit/debit spending is that these are (partially) paid for by credit card transaction fees. I don't think there's any such thing for check processing.

But I had to give it a shot, before going to the next-best alternative (Bilt, I think).

**Why I'm not crazy/context:** Until recently, the bank-like fintech Enzo offered cash back on rent, with a promise to extend this in the future to rent paid by check. (Still applies for old customers.) I'm kicking myself because I was waiting to sign up until they added the check option. For the reasons described above, it makes sense that this sort of thing would just be a ""teaser"" option to get people in the door.

**The alternative that I've found so far:** Like many people, I'm finding that rent is a tricky expense to earn any rewards on. The Bilt Mastercard is a good option, but I'm looking to see whether there's anything better. I think there are better options if you are able to pay rent using another method, such as debit or credit card, PayPal or something else, or if your landlord is in a certain network. **My only available methods are check and Zelle, and I think I can only fund Zelle with a bank account (not a debit card).**",1671999159.0

We are getting into a territory that we feel like we could be doing more with our money but aren’t sure where to start.

So we make about $60k a year (he is primary income). We own our home, we owe $159k on the mortgage financed at 2.625% and pay $905 a month including taxes and insurance. Our home value is roughly $290k as it’s gone up since we purchased. Our cars are paid off and reliable. We have pretty minimal expenses, and have managed to hit $20k in our “emergency fund.” We have a 401(k) through my employer and have about $10k in that, and another IRA from a previous employer of his with about $5k. I am also 8 months pregnant, so our goal is to be able to keep our current house as a rental, and upgrade our home in a few years. Nothing crazy, we just want something slightly bigger if we have a second kid and would like to move one town over to be closer to family/transportation. (I have an eye disease and driving is likely to become an issue for me in the next few years.) 
We feel like $20k is plenty for our emergency fund. It’s in a regular savings account that gets barely any interest. What kind of account can we contribute to from now on that will help us towards a house in the near future? I don’t feel like we should keep adding to the current account when we could be possibly earning more interest, and that’s plenty of accessible cash for us. We also have considered possibly borrowing against some of the equity in this house for a down payment on the next one, but that depends on how high the payments would be.

I’ve already had the valve body and lead frame replaced to “fix” these issues. But obviously no dice. 

I have an appointment at the dealer who replaced my valve body to “look at the truck again”. But I have a feeling I already know the answer. So here’s my question.. 

Was a replacement transmission worth it on these trucks? Mine is in really good shape for its age and mileage. Literally not a spec of rust on it and the engine runs great. I just don’t like the idea of paying almost 1/3-1/2 of what the truck is even worth. 

The kicker is that it is not paid off yet. I still owe about $15.5k. I know I know. I bought at literally the worst time and probably over paid a bit. I also took some long trips with it so that upped the mileage a bit. But regardless. I’ve had multiple dealers tell me that they would give me around $10k for it. So I would have to add $5k or so to the cost of a new truck if I go the route of trading it in on a newer truck. 

I’m 100% okay with keeping the truck. I just don’t want to spend the money on a new trans and then a year later have something else break.

I am really annoyed at how expensive my rent is. I rent a normal 1 bedroom apartment for $1750 and sadly that's kinda what the prices are in the area. Utilities are on me.

My issue is my general cash reserves are low, I have 5k cash, with more coming in due to bonuses in February and tax return. 

My plan was to contribute the bare min for the match instead of maxing retirement accounts next year. Save a bit more aggressively and hopefully have around 20k cash by the time I want to buy. I'm thinking sometime late next year.

Is this a smart idea? I'm scared to take such a massive gamble and I don't want to be in debt that's impossible to claw out of.

\-Is it the entire discount amount, or just the amount exceeding 20% that I am taxed on?

\-If I were to receive a 35% discount on one item, and a 0% discount on another, would I pay 0 taxable income if they were purchased together? Or would I be taxed individually on the one 35% discount item?

Products are sold to us at cost, and because services/software are uniquely difficult to calculate cost, the discount can hit as high as 50-75% at times.

I am 25 M, my brother is 18 M and my mother is 48.

I am at present working and getting a basic pay just to live my own life. I have competed Masters in Science.

My brother is doing BA+LLB from a government college here in India.

My mother is a house wife.

My father has a shop which pays everything he needs.

**Problem :**

My mother took huge loans, both secured and unsecured from banks, communities, etc. Just to pay tuition, hostel fees, extras which was needed for my Masters.

She said, my father always pays half (fixed) fee what university and hostel shows. Nothing more a penny and so, all my extra charges are taken up by my mom.

To manage the extra charges that comes along, when living in another state for masters, my mom took loans and loans, and I was unaware of it.

Now the loan is so much that, she is down, and no one could help her.

It is almost twenty lakhs, because she doesn't know how to manage and she has been deceived at times.

My father left her when confronted and he now's enjoys his life with another woman.

My mother has been getting all the calls from bank and getting  calls and I really feel she might do something...

I tried all the possible ways. I don't earn much to help her even though I want to. I pay as much as I can to relive some amount of loan for her.

My brother, he is really young and he doesn't understand the world yet.

Now my mom is on a streak of getting loans to clear up the old loans and stuffs.

I am tired and I cant think of anything else.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.

The 35 years include 18 years of recorded earned income and another 17 years of $0 reported income, since I emigrated to another country.

There is just one problem in my record. Between the years 1999 and 2000 there is about $60k - $80k missing. During this time, I worked for a series of short-term jobs:

* Full-time work for a small business that was in crisis, finally went out of business a few months after my departure.
* Temp full-time work for a technology company. Went out of business and laid everybody off within a matter of months. This might have been 1099 work.
* Temp placement with a government institution. I was an employee of a temp agency, which also closed its doors a few years later.
* Probably a few more odd computer programming jobs...

I used to be really weird about saving pay stubs for **many, many**  years, but about two years ago I finally discarded everything older than seven years back. Now the oldest document I have is an offer letter from December 2000.

And this has just been stressing me out, so yes, figured I'd get the words of internet strangers, as it helps me feel better to be active lol.

The houses we have been looking at that we tend to like have been anywhere from 440k to 490k.

Our current rent: Anywhere from 2900- 3k a month after water/electric included. This has not been stressful and we have been saving thousands each month.

We will be doing a VA loan, first time buyers. Pre-approved for 1.3 million (lmao)

My income: 135k; bonus 5k+ each year

Husband income: 53k; overtime brings him to about 60k+

I told the VA loan officer I do not want to include overtime or bonuses in our 'salary' when looking at a price range, so that would mean our combined income on paper is: 188k

Our projected salaries should go up a bit over the next few years, but I don't want to depend on that.

I have no debts (no car payment, no credit card payments, etc.) and husband has around 9k left on his car.

No kids atm. Maybe will have one kid in about 4-5 years, no more than one though.

Credit: mine is over 800, his is over 700.

Savings: About 45k cash in savings account (we are a little behind because I had to 'earn my stripes' and made crap money the first few years in my career)

We live moderately. I cook a lot and we are nerds that stay at home and play games. We try to go out for a 'date night' like twice a month or so.

I’m a recent college graduate and I’m moving to a HCOL area later this year for my new job with total comp in the low six figures. I’ve been a long time lurker and I’ve read through the guides and age specific guides as well. 

Im looking for ways to best set myself up financially, so that I have as great of financial health as possible. Currently, I have a decent credit score 700+ and no outstanding debt. I was curious to know if opening a credit card for minimal use is a good idea. I was thinking of using it to pay bills like cable for my apartment in order to raise my credit score. I would pay the credit card bill almost immediately, or in whatever manner is best to build credit. I’m also open to recommendations for credit cards if this is a good idea. 

Additionally, I’m not worried about not being able to pay these bills due to my pay, and because I have built up some savings as a buffer god forbid. 

Thanks for the help!

TLDR: is it a good idea to use a CC to pay bills while having more than the means necessary to pay on time?",1671920049.0
Wondering if they can combine credit accounts?,1,zuo1io,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zuo1io/wondering_if_they_can_combine_credit_accounts/,5,"So I had a personal and very emotional emergency years back that was unexpected and totally drained my finances.

 My cat went in for emergency surgery but when they cut him open they found his digestive tracts lined with a lot of ulcers, so they took a biopsy. After he was recovering from the surgery the biopsy came back positive for cancer. What I thought was going to be a manageable hit of a couple thousand quickly became a sinkhole of an amount you don't want to know the total amount of. And I didn't opt for the most expensive treatment route of chemotherapy either (which would have given him the longest life expectancy out of the options). I went with the more comfortable for him and mid-range expense treatment of radiation pills. I quickly maxed out all my credit cards with this.

 I was working my butt off to pay them off and was managing okay, but then I lost my place of work and my income dropped down by more than half. I also had to move at the time. I was so overwhelmed by everything going on that I didn't know what to do and so just kinda ignored the credit card bills. They went delinquent and then to collections. I continued to just ignore them and now 7 years later they have finally dropped off my credit report and are past the window of time allowed for them to sue me for the money.

 I've been working on rebuilding my credit and have gotten it back up to 740. So now I've got many better options available to me again for new credit cards that aren't secured or suck. 

My question is: if I apply for a new card with one of the same companies with which I still owe $1,000s of dollars to for those old unpaid accounts, even though they're closed, can they still pull that up and ""transfer"" the debt onto my newly opening account? 
Or will they just look at that and automatically deny my application, regardless of what the approval odds say my chances are for getting that card? Do approval odds take such things into consideration? 
Or should I just play it safe and totally avoid those companies I had cards with previously and still technically owe? I paid portions back on all of them, but none of them were paid off in full and each one still has a balance owed of a approx $4k each, which i would work out a payment plan but unfortunately it's just not within my tight budget right now to be able to do so...",1671933097.0

My employer has consistently shorted my paychecks. Not sure how to proceed.,1318,ztb8o2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ztb8o2/my_employer_has_consistently_shorted_my_paychecks/,264,"I've worked at this company part time for the last 5+ years. Recently I noticed that my paychecks were usually between 30 minutes to an hour short of the actual hours that I worked. I don't have copies of the times I clocked in and out, but I used my google maps location history which told me the exact times I arrived and left work.

I've checked about 6 of my recent paychecks and this was true for all of them.

It only results in a loss of about $10-$15 each paycheck. But assuming that this has happened for the past 5 years, the total is probably in the range of $600-$900 that I've lost because of this.

I want to talk to my boss about it, but I want to be prepared beforehand.

What's my best course of action?


Edit: Wow I did not expect this many replies. 

To answer a few common questions: 

I usually work 5-6 hours each shift and don’t take a lunch. When I do take one, it’s unpaid. I take one paid break each shift.

I know that google maps data isn’t the best evidence, but I typically walk straight into work after I arrive and leave right after I clock out. I don’t park far so maybe the times are off by a few minutes each time. I only work 3 times a week and this does not add up to the time that I am missing each paycheck. 

I’m not sure if they are rounding or not, but I read up on it and my understanding is they are supposed to round in a way that is neutral (+/- $0 average loss) or in a way that benefits me. Since there is a consistent loss of hours, if they are rounding they are only rounding down and not up.

I’m usually scheduled from 9 to 2, but I typically leave anywhere from 2-3 so my hours worked are usually more than what I am scheduled.

I am employed in California.

Edit 2: Some people are mentioning that I should only get paid from 9-2 if that’s what I’m scheduled. It is encouraged for people to stay late at my company and many times I have no choice. It is understood that you will get paid for your time if you stay late. So this would not be the reason for the missing hours.

Edit 3: I clock in immediately after arriving at work. It maybe takes me 2 minutes to walk to and from my car. After I clock out, I usually leave right away as well. If I take a lunch, I have to clock in and out for that also. 

Regardless, I know that google maps isn’t sufficient evidence and I will manually track my times with pictures for the next month or so and make sure of it before I say anything to management. 

I definitely did not expect this many replies but I appreciate all the information and advice.",1671787932.0

2 - I’ve helped them open a couple of trad IRAs since we expect their income to be much lower in retirement. Does that sound right?

Trust beneficiary early payout considerations,1,zujgpk,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zujgpk/trust_beneficiary_early_payout_considerations/,11,"Hi there, I could use some guidance.

My wife recently had a family member pass away. The family member had a trust and my wife is one of the beneficiaries. The amount she will receive is in the low-six figures. The trust specifies that the funds not be distributed to the beneficiaries until they reach a certain age (about ten years from now for my wife).

My wife is the only beneficiary that hasn’t reached the age of distribution and the current trustee would prefer not to have to deal with the trust for the next ten years. The trustee has asked my wife if she would be okay with the funds being distributed to her now if she just promises not to use them until the designated age. 

We don’t need the money and have no problems waiting another ten years to do something with it, but I’m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for things we should consider when weighing this proposal.

Are there legal implications to my wife for accepting this money when it’s not technically supposed to be distributed to her yet? What about to the trustee for distributing it early? What about the tax implications of taking ownership of it now as opposed to leaving it in a trust?

My wife has a strained relationship with the trustee so it would be nice to have this over and done with and not have to deal with them for the next ten years, but I’m wary of doing something that could cause problems down the road.

My brokerage account has been a learning opportunity for me. YTD I’m down. Started advance trading. That’s where all my losses are. Turned it into a buy and hold account. Stocks, ETFs I’ve researched and like. This is a 5-10year hold. Maybe use it for a down payment on a house, some large expense later on, or maybe simply passive income for the long run with dividends payments.

My Roth, was something I started with the idea of retirement. I’m currently in the IBEW. So my retirement should be more than fine between my pensions, annuity.

The Plan:
1) Eliminate the excessive credit cards to just 1-2 instead of dozens (saves $$ and eliminates confusion and fraud/theft)
2) Set up auto-pay for as many bills as possible through traditional bank (they have double-paid numerous bills in recent history)
3) Set up a online bank account to funnel daily/online spending.  Monthly funding of this account can be automatic and set to whatever $$ they want.

Figuring out if it's still worthwhile to invest in my company ESPP,1,zuhx0b,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zuhx0b/figuring_out_if_its_still_worthwhile_to_invest_in/,6,"I've been on autopilot regarding the ESPP because from what I've read online, ""conventional wisdom"" is that I should max out the contribution and then sell right away to lock in the (15%) discount.

I've been contributing 15% of each bi-weekly paycheck which is **$507.81** or **$1,015.62** monthly. 

Some background info from the company FAQ: 

> During the enrollment period, eligible employees can elect to contribute between 1% - 15% (whole percentages only) of their base salary earnings for that offering period. Our ESPP will generally be operated with a 24-month offering period that consists of four 6-month purchase periods. At the end of each purchase period, all contributions that have been deducted from your paychecks or otherwise made during that period are used to purchase shares of our Class A common stock.

>> The price of your shares will be the lesser of the following:85% of the fair market value (FMV) of our stock on the first day of the offering period; OR85% of the FMV of our stock on the purchase date.The FMV is the closing price of our Class A common stock on the relevant date. A 24-month lookback means that we will use the closing FMV on the first day of the offering period (the ""offering period beginning price"") and compare it to the closing FMV on the purchase date. Whichever FMV is lower, we apply a 15% discount to determine the purchase price. We will use this method of price comparison on each of the 4 purchase dates in the offering period. For the first offering period commencing on the IPO, we will use the IPO price as the offering period beginning price.

I thought I would take a look at how I've actually performed on the ESPP yesterday, and I was surprised to see the adjusted gain/loss in the red. 

https://imgur.com/a/T63e2Fy

That is with me selling the shares as soon as they hit my account. Unless I'm mistaken, after taxes, I've lost money (**$40.79**) for the year by investing in the ESPP. 

Other things I'm thinking about include: 

- The company stock has nose dived and I'm not bullish on the company at all. The stock is not something I would want to hold long term. 

- On my November 30 paycheck, I got a **$4,461.85** refund for the ESPP because of the ""2,500 share maximum for the number of shares that may be purchased in each six-month purchase period.""

My mindset in the past was that, ""I'll invest, get that 15% discount, and then every 6 months, it'll be like a bonus I'll use for other things (mainly paying off debt at the time that I no longer have)."" 

However, now that I don't have debt, and because I've been on autopilot, I feel like I just gave my company **more than $4,000** to hold on to and not do anything with. That money wasn't working for me the last 6 months. 

- The purchase limit will go up to 5,000 shares for the next purchase in May 2023, but again, I'm not sure if I want to/should be investing in the ESPP anyways.

**What do I do now?** 

1. Suspend the ESPP contribution. Instead of contributing 15% of each paycheck, I contribute 0% which in that case, "" all contributions made previously through the period will be used to purchase shares, but no additional deductions will be made."" 

2. Withdraw completely from the ESPP which will result in, ""a refund of all contributions at any time prior to the end of the purchase period, except for the fifteen (15) calendar day period immediately preceding a purchase date.""

3. Just lower the ESPP contribution. I don't know if this makes sense anyways considering everything I've said previously. 

I'm leaning right now towards options #1 or #2. 

I could take the 15% contribution to the ESPP and instead put it into my 401k to bring the total contribution there to 35% pre-tax. 

I've also considered holding on to the cash where instead of contributing 15% to the ESPP, that money would be a nice mental boost and quality of life upgrade for me.",1671913305.0

Now I have a direct superior who knows that I deserve much more and I earned a new diploma that made them very proud of me, people holding it make at least twice what I earn.

But from what I understand I won't have the bump I was expecting.

I don't know how to go about the situation, "" I know that I deserve more and If I leave I ll find better, I don't wanna leave att because I really have to end many projects, no one can take over on things I do, it will take time for a new person to do it. But I don't wanna sound like "" If you don't increase my salary I'll just leave."" I really don't know how to go about all this situation.

Also I can't speak up for myslef without tears in my eyes. I m really frustrated.

Any tips please?",1671913114.0

I'm a chronic overthinker and will often look a gift horse in the mouth. Something about the situation gave me a bit of anxiety. That being said I called them today and cleared up that I wasn't intending to return and that I wanted to be terminated. 

TLDR;

Got my vacation time paid out from an old summer job that I didn't realize never formally terminated me, just put me on leave. I'm a nervous person and I want someone to tell me I'm overthinking this and that I should just deposit this check and be happy I got a random Christmas surprise.

The company's 3% that I'm ""missing out"" on is worth it in my mind to keep my money liquid. For example, I figure if there's ever an emergency I can just sell some of my stocks off without incurring a penalty (if I were forced to dip into the 401K)

Realize capital gains and/or convert regular IRA's now or later,3,zuahvh,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zuahvh/realize_capital_gains_andor_convert_regular_iras/,10," Me and my wife are retired and we have very little income (10-15K annually from dividends and rental). I am wondering if I should realize capital gain in my taxable accounts (and or perform regular IRA to Roth IRA conversions). I could realize capital gains and pay zero tax as long as I stay within the 15% capital gains tax amounts. I could also perform the regular IRA to Roth conversion to increase income from 10-15K up to 25.9K which is the standard deduction for married couple. In doing either or both of those things, I can pay zero federal tax on that income. The only problem is that I would have to pay the Louisiana state tax now instead of possibly many years later such that I wouldn't have the use of that money that could have grown over time. That growth may be more than the tax savings I would have by paying no federal tax now especially if I still get the same zero tax later when I would take it out.  


I will have to start taking RMD's on my regular IRA's at age 72 and I am 59 now. Also, I probably would not need to start taking social security until age 70.

Other relevant info:

* I will have my company 401k in Fidelity. 
* I am planning on continue having some monthly ETF saving plans + some small individual (hold strategy, long-term, no frequent trading).
* I will likely go back to Europe before retirement (mid-term - maybe in 5/10 years) - would prefer to chose a broker that I can easily use in Europe later or that can easily transfer funds out.

I have seen that Schwab and Interactive Brokers might be good if I later plan to move back to Europe. Not sure if Fidelity has similar perks. If equally good, I could just keep everything in Fidelity since I will have the 401k there either way, but not a must.

Homeless & just got a 10k inheritance,1383,zsvkpa,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zsvkpa/homeless_just_got_a_10k_inheritance/,212,"I'm trying to figure out how to best use the money to help me get some kind of stability. Also I could really use a thorough ELI5 for the benefits mail I [got](https://imgur.com/a/MBjlD0n). 

Some background to help inform advice: 
I've mostly been living in my car for the last 14 months after a traumatic experience earlier that same year left me with PTSD resulting in a sharp decline in my ability to work and subsequent firing. 

I won't go into detail about my symptoms, but on a less than great day in pretty much the scary guy on the corner obliviously ranting to himself in public, and on a bad day I black out and lose all memory of what transpired. It still takes a lot of effort day-to-day day to remain lucid even on a decent day. 

I lived on credit for a while just trying to keep me fed day to day. My mental health has now improved enough that I see my decision making abilities vanished for awhile and I was in pure survival mode. So I went from a perfect credit score and a great job to being delinquent on nearly 20k and using dog sitting jobs to have a place indoors to sleep. 

My car is not in great shape, since I've completely neglected the maintenence, again just didn't have the mental capacity to make it the priority it should be. 

I've tried twice to get disability (Texas) for my PTSD. I am diagnosed, but each time I've applied they've ""lost"" my application and told me to reapply, even after sending me confirmation emails that my application was received and I even had appointment dates confirmed... I talked to a friend of a friend here in Texas who said it took him 2 years of legal battles to get disability for his PTSD and he seems to think that's the status quo for Texas.

So my first thought for the money was to try to get a tiny cheap apartment so that I have some stability and could improve my mental health because just trying to figure out where I'm going to sleep every day takes up a ton of my mental energy. But that would only give me several months at best, if I could even qualify for a lease. 

My next thought was to hire a disability lawyer with the money, but then I'm worried if it really takes so long to get approved I might run out of money before I'm able to.

It was my first credit card and I was able to get it due to my household income/existing savings with the bank. 

My credit score at the time was 614, and this was due to a missed phone bill from August 2021. I switched phone companies and they sent paper mail to my house with the final bill. I didn’t even know where the mailbox was as I lived in student housing, it was certainly carelessness on my part and I paid it off albeit 90 days late. 

I thought that getting approved for a card with a high limit would help my score, at least a bit, but my score stayed at 614. Yesterday, it even dropped to 610.

Before that happens I'm considering selling a large chunk of this stock before the end of the year since I expect I will be taxed less on this sale given my lower salary for 2022. I was planning to put the money into ETFs/index funds for the long run. 

Does does seem like a reasonable move? There is also a question of which batch of shares to sell. I have some batches that have a negative cost basis since I received those when the stock price was high, and others that I got a long time ago with a positive cost basis when the stock price was much lower.

We're both 22, with a university degree and currently taking a Master's. I won't really get into details, but ideally, I'd like to get her out of there within the next year or two (maximum). I will be looking for a full-time job very shortly, but the job market isn't doing very well in my country, and initial wages are very low (even for qualified workers). I'd be happy if I could make 1000€ monthly in net income for my first full-time job, to put things in perspective. In terms of personal savings, I'm honestly very privileged - currently have around 40.000€ saved up. I've considered the pros and cons of buying and renting, and renting seems like the best and most flexible option for now. 

There are a few problems: I do have a driving license, but not a car, which means I'll be a bit geographically limited. Most likely, any work I'll get will be within a big city, which is where rents are astronomically higher. I'll need a house at least nearby, preferably with easy access to public transports. Working from home would be a nice possibility, but I can't rely on that. Another problem - she has a dog, and it absolutely has to come with us. That could make things hard in terms of renting, since a lot of landlords may not accept pets. It's also a decently-sized dog that's used to being outisde, so ideally, we'd like to get an apartment with a small terrace or something like that.

Considering all this, what are my possibilities? In a year or two we'll both be qualified workers, working full-time. Assuming we'll be earning around 24k€ yearly, and assuming rent for a decent house (space for dog, near big city w/ public transport) will be around 11k€ yearly, do you think it would be a bad decision? Is there something I'm not considering?

Another option is to make a loan and buy a house myself, but I have no idea how that would work. I think I'll wait until I actually have a career before thinking about that.",1671845713.0

Long story short, I bought an IUL insurance policy from Transamerica through a family member (around 3 years ago when I was 18) (I was young and did not know better).

Now that I've learned about investing and managing money, I've realized that the fees of the policy are really high and the returns will be much lower than what my agent had advertised. (I know I should have been careful, but since it was a family member, I trusted them blindly)

I dug up the policy documents a few days ago, and basically I want to get rid of the policy (since I will need to pour money into the policy for decades before I get even meagre returns). I have no other experience with insurance policies, so I'm trying to understand what my options are. This is what I've found so far:

Option 1: Surrender the policy (pay a massive surrender fee (\~2x my monthly income)) and I will get nothing back.

Option 2: I also read that my policy will lapse if I stop paying the premiums. I'm wondering if I'd still be charged a surrender charge or will the insurance company just forfiet everything.

TLDR: I won't get anything back from my IUL insurance policy if I terminate it, but can I avoid paying the surrender charge.

I consider myself a PF enthusiast following the guidance of the money guy show. I have my 6 month EF in HYSA and I Bonds, invest 25% of my income, and only owe my house. No credit card debt, auto loans, or student loans. 

My wife and I welcomed our newest member 2 months ago. We often receive visits, which exceeds the vehicle capacity of our sedans (2 sedans). Hence, we sometimes need to drive two vehicles when they stay over and we have to go out. We have considered the idea of purchasing a minivan, and we have narrowed our options to 4

1. Don't buy anything. When we have visits that exceed our vehicle capacity, just use 2 cars

2. Buy an old minivan under 10k and only use it when we have visits to mitigate breakdown. It'd be like a 2009 sienna or something along those years

3. Buy a newer minivan for 25kish (hate this option)

4. Rent a minivan when we have a visit (about $200 per day)

We have no rush to buy a vehicle, so we wanted to reach out to my redditors for some insight.

However, I had to move back in with my dad and his girlfriend.. now, he's a narcissist. He wants me here, and don't mind me living here, simply because he's in control and he feel ""NEEDED"".  I'm 30, I get it, he don't owe me anything... But I need help and he won't help me because he don't want me to be independent... he  never did! He love to feel ""needed"". 

I have no car, I'm in the country, the city is about 25 mins away, there's no jobs nearby. And I'm going crazy and feel like I'll never come out of this. 

What do I do??? 

Now I have about $200, and I have a bunch of junk that I am trying to sell on Craigslist, probably $150 worth. I could potentially have $350 within a few days!

60K Annuity Beneficiary Advice,1,zturxn,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zturxn/60k_annuity_beneficiary_advice/,2,Recently a relative passed away and listed me as the beneficiary on an annuity with about $60K left. I called the company that holds the annuity and the gave me a brief overview. I have to pull the money out within the next 10 years. I can take out as much or as little as I want between now and then but whatever I take gets taxed as income. Right now it’s earning about 4-5% interest. The representative said at the very least I should pull it from the current annuity and put it into a new one because the interest rate would be better now. I’m not planning taking out any this year but on Jan 1 I wake to take out about 30K to pay off credit card and medical debt. What I don’t know is how to reinvest the remaining 30K. Also my wife has 40K in 401K from a previous job and she needs to move that somewhere. I only bring up the 401K in case it would be better to put 70K (my 30 her 40) into something. But we’re fine not combining them. Thanks in advance!,1671835247.0
Never co-sign. No need to learn the hard way.,2693,zsbdd8,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/zsbdd8/never_cosign_no_need_to_learn_the_hard_way/,715,"Just a quick post coming from someone that has co-signed twice and gotten burned twice. Shame on me for not learning my lesson the first time. If you co-sign for someone, you assume the same level or responsibility for that debt that they the primary does. The account lands on your credit report the same way it does theirs. If they stop making payments, those late payments land on your credit report and you're responsible for the debt just as they are.

This probably happens most commonly with family members and significant others, but I'm sure there are examples as well of friends co-signing etc. It's not worth ruining one of these relationships if things take a wrong turn, so just don't get involved. It's better to have a mini battle up front to the tune of ""I understand where you're coming from, but I just don't co-sign / it's not something I'm comfortable doing"" and not get involved rather than a major possibly relationship-ending battle if it doesn't go well.

If I had a top 10 list of my biggest credit-related regrets, looking back the 2 times I co-signed for others would be extremely high up the list, if not at the top.

If anyone would like to share some co-signing horror stories feel free to do so!

Edit:  A few requests throughout the thread have asked me to share my story so I figured I'd add it to the OP with an edit.  So I got burned by two exes, about a decade apart.  Both had subpar credit, although at the time I didn't really understand credit at all as in why it was subpar (payment history issues, etc).  The first one didn't burn me too bad, as there was only maybe a year or so left of ~$250 payments.  You all already know the script... we broke up, payments ceased, I took them over.  A decade later I was much more reluctant to co-sign after my first experience, but the person I was with at the time was having major dental issues... constant pain that went on for weeks and months.  It got to the point where co-signing (Care Credit to get the work done) seemed like the only option.  Again the relationship didn't work out and I was left holding the bag.  Burned twice, so definitely shame on me.",1671681171.0
"Long-Term Disability Survivor Benefit, 3x Gross or Offset?",1,ztuisk,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ztuisk/longterm_disability_survivor_benefit_3x_gross_or/,1,"My mother passed away in July. The year of her death she had been receiving Social Security Disability (SSDI) payments of $1349 per month and Long-Term Disability (LTDI) Benefits of $711 per month. My understanding is that LTDI benefits are offset by any amount paid by SSDI, so if we add them together we should get her gross monthly benefit: $2060 per month.  
  
The policy offers a survivor's benefit that reads: ""*The benefit will be an amount equal to 3 times the Insured's last Monthly Benefit. The last Monthly Benefit is the benefit the Insured was eligible to receive right before his/her death. It is not reduced by wages earned while in Rehabilitative Employment.*""  
  
I've jumped through the hoops necessary to claim this survivor's benefit, and just received a letter confirming they'll be sending out a check. Of course I receive this letter as they close on a holiday weekend, so I'm reaching out to Reddit in hopes this won't be nagging at me for the next several days.  
  
The letter states that the Survivor Benefit has been calculated to the amount of $2133. This appears to be three times the offset amount of $711 that the insurance company had been paying every month. I *expected* this amount to not be offset, as SSDI payments do not continue after death and the gross monthly benefit was $2060 per month. I *expected* a Survivor Benefit of three times the gross monthly benefit, or $6180.  
  
Who is in the wrong here? Are we being shorted or were my expectations not in line with reality? Thanks for any insight in advance.",1671834542.0

Forgive my lack of knowledge. I am still learning.

I have a friend of mine from Brazil. He told me that in Brazil there are some investments that pay inflation + an interest.

So, technically there would be a real gain of 4%, given the inflation was 8% as in the example above.

We were 5 of us and each had 1 personal item so did not pay any extra for the check-in item.

The onward journey was fine, but on our way back with the exact same baggage, after we reached back home I saw a charge for $89 for an extra check-in item. No authorization, no talks, just the cardless charge posted.

I tried contacting Frontier on this surprise and no response, FB / Email/calls...none.

So I resorted to help from Citi card on this. Citi filed a dispute and the first response from Frontier was, proof of my boarding pass and the fact that I flew. While I have never denied that I flew.

I sent a follow-up to Citi explaining the charge was for extra Check-in bags and finally, after weeks Citi got back to me saying the merchant is not honoring the chargeback and so the dispute is closed in favor of the merchant.

I'm honestly surprised the core issue was never addressed and there is no support from Citi or Frontier on explaining the charge.

I must add 1 odd incident, while we boarded the plane, my kid was scanning the boarding pass while we boarded & I was the last.

Financial checkup please,1,ztrgu3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ztrgu3/financial_checkup_please/,6,"Hey everyone, so essentially I just want your thoughts on how am I doing? I try to be financially responsible but honestly feel quite apprehensive at times. I know some people are doing better and some are doing worse, I just want a check up from a neutral party. I’m open to recommendations, budget changes etc. 

Here’s the break down
24, married (wife is also 24) incomes of 85k and 40k.
Totally income 125k, net around 7k a month. That’s after health insurance, and 18% ish going into retirement funds (401ks in target date funds, and state pension)

Monthly expenses come out to around 3.5k. That leaves 3.5 remaining. Currently save about 3k into cash savings (2k for planning to buy a car in the next 6 months, and 1k of that is for travel)  500 is going into a taxable account with fidelity (total US market index fund). 
I realize the travel is huge, but honestly we really like traveling so it feels worth it? 
As for assets around 5k in checking that’s a slush fund for monthly expenses, 5k already slated for a car purchase, and 20k as a E fund. 1k in the taxable brokerage account and like 15k across retirement accounts. 

We own our home (idk worth 100k) and both our vehicles (wife’s will be upgraded soon). 

I just worry with how much we spend, I mean the car will be purchased late this spring, and travel savings for the year will be done by February (already have plane tickets, the last 2k is for accommodations). 

Once the car and travel is wrapped up I will probably shift most of that into the taxable account. Not sure what that is for yet, but I’m a saver by nature.

I guess I should also mention I plan to start my masters this fall (engineering) that’s an additional 4k a year for 5 years. Still debating but leaning that way for career growth.

I apologize if this is rambling, I just never h e had money and somehow ended up here. I just want a sanity check, does everything make sense? Am I missing some key thing?

Roth 401(k) versus traditional 401(k)+Brokerage,0,ztw6j0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ztw6j0/roth_401k_versus_traditional_401kbrokerage/,7,"I should probably do the math, but figured it would be best to go to the PF minds here to ask first.  I have looked through the internet and am having trouble finding guidance for this specific situation.

My wife and I started saving in our early thirties after completing graduate school and make a bit over $300k/yr gross income between our two roles.  We have no dependents and are currently 35.  We are ""behind"" on retirement saving based on the traditional ""1.5x-2.0x income by 35"" metric that financial advisors often quote, but have a decent nest egg and continue to plug away.  Outside of our 3% mortgage ($290k) and a 0% car note ($25k), we hold no debt.

Our current savings are as follows with >95% stocks in VTI/VTSAX:

* 401(k)'s - $210k
* Roth IRA's - $20k
* HSA's - $10k
* I-bonds - $20k
* Brokerage Account - $150k
* Unvested RSU's - $110k (we convert to VTI/VTSAX as they vest)
* HYSA - $5k (low for an emergency fund, but our jobs are fairly recession-proof and we can get liquidity from I-bonds if necessary.)
* Home equity - $100k
* Our firm also subsidizes term life insurance - we pay $10/month for \~$800k coverage which is active until we separate from our company
* Defined-benefit pension plan - I believe if we stay until 65, the pension pays out something like 33% of salary at that time.  Need to confirm this.

Currently, our savings strategy is as follows:

* Max out 401(k)'s - $41k/yr in 2022 + employer match of \~$15k
* Max backdoor Roth IRA's - $12k/yr in 2022
* Max out HSA's - \~$7k/yr in 2022
* Based on balance of emergency fund, deposit $3k-$4k monthly in brokerage account with no tax advantages

My question - We are evaluating our savings strategy for 2023.  Our 401(k) plan supports roth contributions and conversions from our traditional 401(k) balance to roth 401(k), but does not support Mega Backdoor Roth strategies to make additional contributions beyond the annual limit of $20,500/yr.  Is it advisable to continue saving all $41k/yr in our standard 401(k) accounts and rolling the tax savings into VTI in our brokerage account OR would it be preferable to save $41k/yr in the 401(k) on a roth basis, taking the tax hit early, and not being able to contribute as much in the brokerage?  I know that the brokerage account is more liquid than the 401(k) and the current strategy allows us to be more flexible with funds, but our goal for the brokerage account is mainly to use it as a retirement supplement.",1671839101.0

What to do with 401k at age 66,0,ztqev9,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ztqev9/what_to_do_with_401k_at_age_66/,2,"My retired dad (66) has recently (October) decided to work part time valeting cars for a medical facility at $15hr/30hr weekly.

My dad only started contributing to retirement funds (401k) when he started working at the hotel. He had about $19k when he retired but he said now is down to $15k.  My dad doesn’t have any debt, and pays monthly bills with his social security check.  His car has recently started causing him some issues and mentioned using majority of the 401k to purchase a used car.  I think if he’s gonna do it, it should be this year since his income is so low and hopefully the 401k won’t be heavily taxed.  Am I giving him good advice?

Today, I got an alert that my credit score went down over 30 points with TransUnion and Equifax.

- non qualified contributions added to 2022 taxes
- additional 10% tax penalty on the non qualified amount

That’s fine. 

What is not clear is whether I would need to withdraw the non-qualified contributions after the penalty is paid, thus incurring an additional 20% for a non-healthcare withdrawal and removal from the account.
