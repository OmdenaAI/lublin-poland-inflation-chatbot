"What would happen if I walked into a bank to deposit $1 million dollars in cash? Do most banks have machines that do the counting?","https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-into-a-bank-to-deposit-1-million-dollars-in-cash-Do-most-banks-have-machines-that-do-the-counting","80.1K views","917 upvotes","2 shares","38 comments","To deposit $1 million cash in a bank, first the bank will want to know where this money came from. This is called “Know Your Customer.” This is a federal law and they can get into huge amounts of trouble if they just took your money.
Assuming they buy your story on how you got the money, they will have to count it. If it is all $100s, then a teller should be able to count it all in under an hour. If it is in mixed denominations, it will take much longer even with a machine (not all branches have those machines).
After they finish counting your money, they have to fill out a federal form telling the government that you just deposited a large amount of cash. This may make the government curious and they could start an investigation on you.
Also, the branch that you went to may not want to take your money. Because banks don’t like a lot of cash around for security reasons, they will have to schedule another visit from the armored car company to get rid of the cash. That will be an additional expense. Plus if it is a small branch, they may not have extra tellers to sit down and count all of your money.","","",""

Because they are lazy thinkers — they don’t find better ways to provide value in the marketplace.
Because they don’t improve themselves— no time for financial literacy, developing skills, shifting mindset, etc.
Because they never take action. — they will never start any business or try anything and just feel good reading such answers.
Because they don’t save money — you can’t make money work for you if you don’t have any.
Because they have bad beliefs about money — “money is evil” and “If you make millions, you take away from the poor”.
Because they are scarcely selfish— they don’t want to provide value instead just want to make a quick buck and run.
Because they don’t budget and live above their means — poor financial skills.

"Is it worth buying a Lamborghini or is there a fancier status symbol out there?","https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-buying-a-Lamborghini-or-is-there-a-fancier-status-symbol-out-there","347.9K views","10.3K upvotes","78 shares","116 comments","As someone that owns a Lamborghini I can tell you unequivocally that it is worth buying the car…. IF you are an enthusiast, and/or own a business that credibility is important and/or love the hilarious situations that you will find yourself whilst owning a lambo.
Case and point, below you will see a local rapper that messaged me on Instagram asking to rent my Huracan Spyder for his video shoot.
$4,000 and 3 hours later, I was able network with some awesome people in the music business which subsequently led to a joint purchase of a $3mm multi-family apartment complex.
I also got to participate in my first rap music video - which is actually a lot of fun, and some how still made $1,300/hour.
I would have never found myself in this situation driving a BMW 750i!!!
The Lambo also adds a ton of credibility when you are meeting people already within your industry. In this case below I was driving around town and this guy stops me in his Rolls Royce wraith and asked how I was able to buy the lambo.
Once he found out I was in real estate he told me he was a local developer, one thing led to another and now we are working on buying a portfolio of houses together.
So bottom line if you are buying a Lambo to show off and you aren’t an ethusiast - it will be a waste of money. They aren’t practical, most of the people you run into will ask for a picture and if you can’t leverage that interest/attention into a monetary benefit - you won’t have much except an ego boost and a bunch of random pictures of your car on Facebook.","","",""

I retired in November 2021 just before I reached age 68. I am well off, but definitely not wealthy.
Only about 30–40% of my own and wife’s income is coming from social security, the rest is coming from 401K’s, IRA’s, pensions, and stocks. Plus, I no longer have a mortgage or any other significant debts. And, we are now living in a brand new custom-designed 2500 square foot Italian-villa style home on 1.2 acres in the Texas Hill country that we paid cash for from the sale of our California home in the Silicon Valley. The 500 square foot upstairs portion is an independent studio apartment with its own separate entrance, a full bathroom, and a kitchenette. We currently rent it out to local college students but it will be for our in-home care-giver when we are too old to take care of ourselves. Our annual income is only around $100,000 per year, (I made over twice that in the Silicon Valley), but we have no bills except utilities, groceries, property taxes, and supplemental healthcare insurance. Medicare is our primary coverage and it pays about 80% of outpatient care, the low-cost supplemental insurance pays the remainder.
I planned almost 20 years ahead for all this. I suggest you all do the same.

My wife loved that show and thought they were hilarious.
I thought they were annoying, entitled jerks.
Ostensibly, Todd and Julie were successful real estate developers who lived a lavish lifestyle. That turned out not to be so true. What they were actually doing was inflating the value of their properties for loan purposes, using that money to finance their lifestyle, then getting other loans to pay off the debts. It was a Ponzi scheme with banks as the investors. Along the way, they developed and presented fake financial statements to inflate their net worth and income when it was convenient and deflate those numbers when the tax man came calling.
If all this sounds familiar, it should.
After being convicted of bank, tax, and wire fraud, Todd got 12 years in Federal prison, and his wife, Julie, got seven years. They each got 2 - 3 years of supervised release as well. Under federal rules, they will have to serve 85% of their sentences, so Todd will next breathe free air in 2034 and Julie in 2029.

You’ll need to check your state laws, but that is normally correct. It’s true here in Nevada.
In order to counter an offer, you must accept it subject to the terms of the counter offer. You cannot accept more than one offer, so you cannot counter more than one.
If you have multiple offers and don’t really like any of them, have your realtor contact their agents and ask for their “highest and best” offer, then accept one of those. Or you can reject them all and hope another, better offer comes along.","","",""

“Who’s going to pay for all these expenses?” my friend asked me. “Two of my wife’s siblings don’t have the money to cover these expenses. Now my wife expects me to pay these outrageous sums of money. That’s not fair! Why should I pay for everything?”
I looked at him. No response came to mind.
He then leaned forward and said to me in a low voice, “I mean, really … she’s not even my mother. They should pay her expenses as I will pay for my mother’s expenses!”
Incredible! Nobody likes to talk about this. Honestly, it’s painful!
We’re all living longer, (which is great in many ways,) but what happens when people don’t plan accordingly and do not have enough retirement savings to live for the next 20 or 30 years?
I know what I’m talking about. My dad just turned 90, and believe me, the expenses for taking proper care of both of my parents are staggering! Costs are skyrocketing!

Poor Boy vs. Rich Boy
Poor Boy:
Household income is less than $40,000 USD. This is poverty level in my county.
He is a very talented musician. His parents can’t afford lessons to improve his skills. He resorts to watching YouTube and practices on a piece of crap, used instrument.
Struggles academically, parents can’t afford tutoring. Starts to feel that he is falling behind in everything. Anxiety increases from relentless stress.
No real after-school activities, like sports, until middle school and even those require quite a bit of money for equipment and other costs. Parents have rent to pay, frivolous after school programs are not realistic.
Rich boy:
Parents have combined income of $180,000. That makes you an upper class citizen in my area.
Very talented musician. Parents have a music teacher come twice a week for one hour each session. The child also has a special room in the house just for his music, filled with a computer desk, music stands, several instruments of the same type in case one breaks a string or whatever else. The room is nearly soundproof and has beautifully painted walls with music notes flying everywhere. There are recording devices attached to the computer so the child can practice and show his instructor that he did work.
Struggles academically. Parents hire a top-rated student to come and tutor the child. Child grows up, parents get him a specialized standardized testing teacher (ACT, SAT, etc) to prepare for the most important tests in their schooling life.
After school activities keep the child busy and away from home until 5–6pm everyday. Karate, sports clinics of all kinds, soccer, wrestling, fencing, boxing and whatever else. The parents can’t be home so he has to do these things.
Now… who do you think will get ahead most of the time? Of course, the child with stronger financial backing.
Hard work only gets you so far. What if you’re rich AND a hard worker? You’re only going to improve exponentially faster. There is no denying this.

Money is better than intellect for predicting who will succeed in life
“Rich children of average intelligence are more likely to succeed in life than brilliant people born into poor families, according to a new genetic study that focuses on the intersection of genes and economics.”
“Ultimately, less than a quarter (24 percent) of high-potential people born to low-income fathers graduated from college, compared to 63 percent of those born to high-income fathers.”
https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2018-05-28/income-inequality-exacerbates-the-achievement-gap
“By many measures, poor kids participated in fewer educationally enriching activities over the summer than middle class and wealthy kids. Only 7 percent of poor kids and 13 percent of ‘near’ poor kids (families of four living on an income of $22,000 to $44,000 a year) went to summer camp. Roughly 40 percent of non-poor kids – middle class and wealthy – attended summer camp. The poor were less likely to go on cultural outings. For example, only 32 percent of poor kids and 44 percent of ‘near’ poor kids went to an art gallery, a museum or a historical site over the summer. Almost two-thirds, or 63 percent of non-poor kids, did. Only 15 percent of poor kids attended a concert or a play. One third of non-poor kids did.”

“A few years ago, Sean Reardon (2012) of Stanford University published an analysis of the findings of many studies showing, over all, that the gap in achievement test scores between students from the richest 10% of families and the poorest 10% grew by 40 to 50 percent between the mid 1970s and the early 2000s.. The gap exists at all grade levels, but is much larger in the later years of schooling than in the early years. By the middle of high school, the average test scores for students from the bottom 10% in income are three to six grade levels (depending on the type of test) below those of students from the top 10% in income.”","","",""

It was 1981 and I was a starving college student, literally starving. I had just gotten on food stamps and was still buying Pilchard, a disgusting tuna substitute that was much cheaper than tuna. I lived on unbranded peanut butter and saltines many days. In those days you could even get generic corn flakes.
I had a friend who was rich, drove a 280Z to school every day, yada, yada, yada. Invited me to dinner with his folks one day. A free meal!!! I was good to go. It turns out they weren’t expecting me, his mom and dad were sitting in their cluttered kitchen with dirty pots and pans on the stove, steam coming off them, but they invited me to sit with them and eat catch-as-catch-can with them.
I put the fork in my mouth. My head nearly exploded.
It was the most incredible thing I could ever remember eating and this was their “average” dinner together. I couldn’t even imagine what their “real” meals were like. The mother loaded me up with leftovers. They gave me a bottle of Welch’s White Grape Juice. I had never in my life had anything like Welch’s White Grape Juice. It cost almost 5 dollars for a small bottle in 1981. In 1981, 5 dollars was almost my entire weekly food budget. Welch’s White Grape Juice might as well have been gold because I could never afford it on the best day of my life. Nowadays it’s nothing special but back then I was staggered by it.
So yes, compared to poor people, the quality and preparation of food by rich people is not just on another planet, it’s in another galaxy.","","",""

Middle class is one who has most of his basic needs satisfied. However, they are not happy or live most lively life because of their craving to become rich.
The middle class people have to work under the rich people and they see the lifestyle of the riches with close distance.
While poor people don’t crave to become rich, because they know it is too difficult, most middle class people aspire to become rich as many of them can achieve this feat.
Given a choice, they would like to become rich.
As far as the rich people are concerned, they have all the material needs satisfied. They always have the option to become poor or middle class, but hardly anyone choose to be so.

I can’t complain, I got to turn it on once and hear it roar. It was a cool purple color.

We were learning about emergencies and electric fires and what to do in those situations.
Seemingly innocent enough right?
Our teacher had asked a benign question to the class relating to the number of smoke detectors each of us had in our homes. One by one she went around the room and each student in my class answered the question aloud. Some students had one due to small houses, others two and few lucky and obviously more affluent students had three or more in their homes.
When my turn came around, I eagerly answered that we had none, not a single smoke alarm in our home. My teacher, concerned and equally perplexed, inquired what we would do in the event of an electrical fire.
Triumphantly, I replied it was of no concern as we did not have any electricity in our home.
Silence. Deafening silence. It’s one of those silences that one experiences in a dream when everyone suddenly realizes you're naked in a public place. That feeling.
Anyway, she stared at me in a cross between concern and bewilderment.
Immediately I was in the hallway with her and she was inquiring as to how long it had been since our electricity had been shut off.
I told her we’d never had electricity.
She asked if we had our water service.
I said yes, we haul the water from a well every morning before I come to school.
She stared at me in utter disbelief.
Next thing I know we are in the principal’s office and my principal, who was a very large man resembling Mr. Clean in a suit, was explaining to her that my family has no modern conveniences and we live completely off the grid.
Now things became interesting.
We return to class and everyone starts asking how we watch tv.
We don’t.
How do we do laundry?
Laundromat once a week.
How do we keep the milk cold?
We don’t, we drink it as we soon as we are done milking the cow for breakfast. Why would we keep it cold?
How do we stay warm?
We use the stove in the living room filled with the wood we chop.
How do we play video games?
I’ve never seen one before.
And like a light bulb, I realized I was the only person in my class who lived like this.
Suddenly everything clicked for me. All my toys were made by my mom.
All my clothes were the same and never from a store.
I went home after school and worked in our garden.
I went home that day and asked my mom why we did not have the things other kids had.
She laid it out for me.
Her and my Dad were in debt.
They couldn’t afford to have the water lines installed and the electricity ran to our trailer.
The trailer we lived in was the best we could afford.
My dad and my mom were living like this with my brother and I because my dad happened to own the land and didn’t want to sell. It was all they had.
They were homesteading it.
We lived like this because we had no choice.
After that day, I realized I was poor. And that feeling has been with me every day of my life ever since.
I used to go to the bathroom in a fence row because we had no toilet. I got worms because of this as I’d frequently walk barefoot through feces.
We shared bath water as a family and we bathed in a horse trough in our kitchen.
I was seven years old. I had no friends in school and was always treated like I didn’t matter.
And I didn’t.
The poor kid in your class that everyone shunned, that is me.
An innocent question about smoke alarms led to one of the great realizations of my childhood.
I should’ve known sooner how different we lived but I didn’t.

Just up the street from my apartment in Chicago Marshall Berlin, the wealthy Vice Chairman of the I. S. Berlin Publishing Company, threw a metal chair and pushed his nude “girlfriend” to her death through the window of his high rise apartment in the John Hancock Building.
When the police arrived Mr. Berlin was not even there. But his lawyer was. Berlin did not call an ambulance or the police. He called his lawyer!
Berlin refused to answer questions or take a lie detector test. The building windows had to be sent out of state for testing because it was believed that a Chicago or Illinois company could be too easily bribed. Berlin got away with murder. Woman falls from John Hancock Center - Newspapers.com
These are just five of hundreds of cases I could cite where a wealthy man committed murder or child rape and used his wealth and influence to get away with it.
On a smaller scale, I know a guy who because he is a big political campaign contributor is “connected” and cannot be arrested. He routinely violates traffic laws directly in front of cops and they won’t touch him. They recognize his car and very low license plate number and let him do what he wants. He even laughs about it, saying “Watch this” as he does something egregiously illegal right in front of a couple of cops. The one time that I know he was stopped, by some honest cops who did not recognize him, he used his mobile phone to speed dial someone in the mayor’s office and simply handed his phone to the cop. The cop repeatedly said “Yes Sir” to someone on the phone and then repeatedly apologized to Mr. Big for inconveniencing him.
In my town a there is a woman from a prominent family who is a drunk. When she was stopped for drunk driving the cops, rather than arresting and charging her as they would do to you, called the mayor to ask what to do. The mayor drove to the site of the stop, ordered the cops to forget the incident happened, and gave the very drunken woman a ride home. The cops obediently complied.
Why? How do wealthy people get away with crimes?
At every stage of of the crime and the investigation and, if there is one, the trial the wealthy person will be treated very differently than you or I would.
Cops are frightened of wealthy men and reluctant to offend them. The wealthy belong to the same clubs and socialize with and give campaign contributions to the politicians who control whether the cop has a job or not. The wealthy can and do make trouble for anyone who crosses them. And they have more reason to use that influence and call in favors if they have committed a crime.
Many government agencies and police departments restrict access to files concerning politicians, the politically connected, celebrities, and the wealthy. These files are kept in secure areas to which access is severely restricted. As early as the 1970s computer systems at these agencies and departments were configured to block access to these VIP files. Access required special authorization from the top brass. Any attempt to look at them without such approval, for example merely typing in the name of a VIP, would trigger an alarm and start an investigation, not of the VIP, but of the employee who dared to look at the files.
The wealthy have lawyers and fixers on retainer and on speed dial. They pay them enough so that no matter where they are or what hour it is their mouthpieces will show up to protect them. When Marshall Berlin pushed his girlfriend through that high rise window and her body smashed on the pavement Berlin’s lawyer arrived before the cops and was waiting for them.
There are means by which the wealthy can deliberately commit crimes while avoiding prosecution. Wealthy clients frequently ask lawyers, accountants, and bankers: “How can I get away with this?” There are ways to deceptively structure criminal business operations and tax evasion schemes so as to both disguise them and make them so expensive and difficult to trace that prosecution is highly unlikely and a defense is designed in. Law firms and accountants and banks will do this.
The wealthy NEVER talk to cops. Any information the cops get is only obtained through the wealthy man’s lawyer after negotiation.
Unless you are in some place like the Southern District of New York, the local prosecutors are always over worked and out classed by the legal dream teams that defend the wealthy. Thus prosecutors, who have limited office budgets and who retain their jobs based upon their win loss ratios, are very reluctant to even bring a case against the wealthy.
If they do go to trial the wealthy can afford to buy exonerating testimony from “expert witnesses”. When she worked as an attorney for a legal mega-firm my wife kept a list of doctors and experts known to be corrupt whom she referred to as prostitutes for hire. They would sell their services to the highest bidder and say whatever they were paid to say.
The wealthy can select a jury that favors them. They do this by hiring psychologists to advise their attorneys during the jury selection process and expensive private investigators who examine the lives of every potential juror. Thus, before the trial even starts the jury box will already be stacked with jurors who favor the wealthy defendant.
Before a trial even begins the wealthy defendant will have hired a very expensive public relations firm that will not only develop a plan of marketing the defendant to the jury but will attempt to subvert the entire jury pool through a massive marketing campaign.
It is common for wealthy criminal defendants to hire professional wardrobe consultants and image and makeup consultants. What the jury sees on the stand is not the defendant but a professionally trained and made up and costumed actor.
The wealthy who routinely engage in criminal activities or business practices for which they could be prosecuted if caught assiduously culture acquaintances with and offer favors to the power elite and ostentatiously donate a part of their ill gotten gains to the social associations for the wealthy that masquerade as charities. This allows them, if needed, to call in favors or have others testify to their “good character”. Interestingly this protective behavior was originally promoted by the gangster Al Capone and was made mandatory by Chicago’s Lawndale mob which required that their sleazy members all contribute to charities.
The wealthy can avoid prosecution by simply buying off their accuser, paying hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars to make cases go away. The list of such men is seemingly endless. Donald Trump’s fixer is going to jail for this. But the list of the more notorious includes Harvey Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly, Roger Ailes, and Michael Jackson. The wealthy can simply pay to make charges go away.
Judges are generally white men from the privileged classes. Although they are often hostile to and treat the poor and minorities very badly, they are very deferential towards the wealthy. I have seen these two behaviors from the same judge many times. For example, Judge T. S. Ellis, when sentencing Paul Manafort to less than the minimum recommended sentence, stated that Manafort had “lived an otherwise blameless life”. Manafort had not only lied to the FBI and engaged in witness tampering and committed crimes while awaiting trial but had enriched himself by engaging in tax fraud and bank fraud for thirty years! Judges protect their own social class.
The wealthy can buy District Attorneys and Judges. Doubt this? Look up Operation Greylord in Chicago. Operation Greylord - Wikipedia
. Or read about the Non-Prosecution Agreement that allowed Jeffrey Epstein to avoid a life sentence and stopped the investigation of the other very wealthy men involved with Epstein. Opinion | Nothing about Jeffrey Epstein's deal with prosecutors was remotely normal
Yes. If you have enough of it, money in the United States allows a person to get away with crime. As my attorney wife frequently tells me: “In the United States you can have as much justice as you can pay for”.","","",""
"What are the best arguments for Bitcoin maximalism?","https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-arguments-for-Bitcoin-maximalism","15 views","42 shares","1 comment","","Throughout time, something we've seen over & over again is governments/kings/rulers debasing money. And when they debase money this usually leads to a collapse in society.
More recently we've seen this play out in the US, especially since the creation of the Federal Reserve. The government, with the help of the Fed, has printed money consistently, because the supply of money increases this creates inflation (price increases).
Constant inflation is a hidden tax because it steals purchasing power away from people who hold money, and worse, it steals the benefits of price deflation from society that would've been produced by the free market driving down prices via competition.
This inflation also incentivizes speculation and asset bubbles because the value of money/savings decreases it forces people to buy financial assets, which reduces the size of the real economy and increases the size of the financial economy further adding to the problem.
Inflation not only discourages saving but it encourages debt because the debt can be paid back with cheaper money (less purchasing power) in the future. But it gets worse, because wages rarely keep up with rate of inflation the purchasing power or income, not just savings, goes down crushing the standard of living for the poor/middle class.
This toxic stew leads to inevitable social unrest and instability. We're currently seeing this play out in front of our own eyes, and with every additional dollar that is printed we get closer and closer to collapse. Also, since this fiat system of inflation is built on debt, the only way to sustain it is if there is more and more money printed (inflation). IOW more and more theft, bigger government/crony capitalism and less freedom, liberty, free market capitalism.
BUT.….BITCOIN fixes this.
Bitcoin provides base money that can't be manipulated by governments, meaning money can no longer be printed, there's a fixed amount of 21M which is impossible to increase. If this base money is impossible to increase it will eradicate the root cause of all the problems mentioned above and society will reap the benefits.
These benefits include but are not limited to the following which is basically the inverse of the issues created by money printing/inflation.
1. 100% productivity gains enjoyed by society because of % lost by fiat system is eliminated.
2. Money/Savings always increasing in value.
3. Little to no speculation because peoples savings would appreciate at such a rate speculative risk/reward wouldn't make sense.
4. Little to no debt because aggregate increase in societies purchasing power, things people use debt to buy (houses) would dramatically come down in price because of lack of need to speculate and, maybe more so, because no one will want to take on debt knowing they'll have to pay it back with appreciated money.
5. Real economy would increase, financial economy would decrease to a level of insignificance because no one had an incentive to do anything other than save. Also, since you can self custody bitcoin, it would eliminate the need for banks all together, although investment pools may still exist.
6. Global economy would also boom because frictionless, peer to peer, transfer of money increases velocity which decreases need to add to base money with more units (similar to today's ""broad money"" metric) i.e. fractional reserve, not to mention fact bitcoin is divisible, so as the money consistently gained value it could easily fill the credit needs of an expanding economy.
7. The size of government would dramatically shrink because they're no longer able to print money, which would not only reduce current spending but future spending because they can't steal purchasing power via inflation anymore.
This, of course, leads to more freedom, liberty, free markets.
WILL THIS TRANSITION OCCUR? YES, BUT IT’S NOT A MATTER OF IF BUT WHEN. WHY?
This is because history shows us, people always gravitate to the hardest form of money (see Gresham's Law) and there is no form of money as sound/hard as Bitcoin alive currently. This is undebatable if you understand bitcoin.
Additionally, we know all fiat currencies go to zero and we're moving in that direction quickly because of the fact the debt based, theft based, ponzi scheme monetary system we have now requires more and more money printing which makes its demise that much more certain.

Now, that isn’t great. But it is a long, long way from 99.99%. And, even if the US had perfect income mobility, you would still expect 20% of people born in the bottom quintile to finish up in the bottom quintile.
Curiously, it is almost exactly the same in reverse for the top quintile. If you start in the top fifth, there is a 40% chance you will stay there - roughly double the chance if there was perfect social mobility. But curiously there is no overwhelming pattern to the middle three quintiles. The highest outcome percentage is just 24%, which is your chance of ending up in the fourth quintile if you start in either third or fourth.

Qatar practices a madhab (school of thought) in Islam that is more closely aligned with that of Saudi Arabia. The difference is, much like the UAE, Qatar opened up to the outside world much earlier.
I’ve been to Qatar & one of my sisters actually went to university in Qatar. She often said that the local Qataris were more religious than many Iranians. Most abstained from alcohol, prayed daily, visited the mosque on Fridays, and dressed modestly. Even the wealthier students at her university could often be seen dressed like this.
But Qatar is very modern, and given the large and rapidly expanding expatriate population, the locals are relatively tolerant of other faiths & cultures. Qatar is also seeking to grow its international relevance, so they’re walking a tricky tightrope of maintaining their conservative image while also showing that they’re open to foreign business & tourism.
What many people don’t realize is that Qatar is actually playing a very clever game of politics. Qatar is amplifying & publicizing its strict (for the average WC) rules in an attempt to gain respect & prestige in the Muslim world. Many Westerners are looking at the rules with disgust. But many people in the Muslim world & even some conservative Christians are praising Qatar for not backtracking on their religious laws.

$500,000 will become $250,000 after tax in some places. It will stay at $500,000 in some locations like the UAE, Monaco, Cayman etc, assuming you aren’t an American who hasn’t renounced citizenship.
In a low-tax and low-cost place like Bulgaria or Georgia, you could live like a king on 500k and save and invest loads of money on the side.
In comparison, you could easily spend $500,000 in Hawaii, LA, New York or London if you aren’t careful.

The point is, it is easy to be “rich” and not wealth and secure.
Those who become wealthy from normal backgrounds, eventually work out some basic facts such as:
It is better to focus on what your money can earn you, and not buy you. If you do that, eventually you will be able to buy more anyway.
Spending money on fun experiences and things which tend to go up in price over time, is better than most consumer goods. If you buy a holiday home, for example, it might not be the best investment in the world. But if it at least matches inflation and gives you a rental yield during the month when you aren’t in town, it can make sense if you are also buying it for lifestyle.

"Do most millionaires still have their money after five years?","https://www.quora.com/Do-most-millionaires-still-have-their-money-after-five-years","23.2K views","30 upvotes","6 shares","","It is a good question. Most people wrongly assume that “the rich always get richer”, which implies that the same people and families always get richer.
The reality is that doesn’t usually happen. Look at the Forbes and the 2020–2021 list, and other rich lists today.
Few of the people on that list had wealthy great grandparents.
However, most wealthy people still have money after five years. Even fifty years is common.
What is less common is having wealth which lasts many generations as this ancient Chinese expression says:
In a UK episode of Dragons Den (Shark Tank), the grandson of the famous founder Cadbury came to ask for money.
His grandad gave the money to charity.
Other reasons why wealth ends is:
Putting all your eggs in one basket. There are many formerly wealthy people from Zimbabwe and other countries where the political winds changed
Not planning for unexpected events such as pandemics , ill health, wars etc.
Family disputes including divorce
Not adapting to changing market preferences if the bulk of your assets are in a business. Look at Kodak.
Not having enough liquidity. This can affect business and property owners more than those who own ETFs, cash and other liquid investments.
But losing wealth in five years? You really have to do something majorly wrong to see your wealth disappear so quickly.
The main reasons for such a sudden fall in wealth are likely to be using too much leverage.

If we dig down further though, there has to be some root causes of that.
The main ones are
Advertising wealth. If somebody does that, some hangers on will want handouts. Only people with high resolve can say no to everybody. A small percentage of people, usually within the person’s circle of trust like so-called friends, will intentionally try to take advantage.
Lack of planning. If somebody makes $10million from the lottery, that sounds like a lot of money and indeed is a lot of money for 99.9999% of people. However, that is only about $400,000-$500,000 of yearly income for life if it is invested well. Yes, the stock markets and many other investments have done more than 4%-5% per year, but you also have to factor in inflation and have a conservative buffer in case the assets perform worse than historical averages. That is a maximum of $1,369 a day. That isn’t enough to “live like a king” 365 days a year and never go bust. Now let’s say somebody buys a house and loads of luxury items + gives some money to family, so they are left with $5million. That is $600-$700 a day. A bored lottery winner who has given up work could easily spend that online in an hour. A complacent lottery winner will also assume “why is spending 2k a day excessive when I have millions”?
Extremes when it comes to risk. Putting the money in the bank won’t work for many people. We live in an era of 0% interest rates. Inflation will erode the money. You will run out unless you are very frugal as inflation compounds. Getting 0% in the bank when inflation is at 2%-3% per year is an indirect 28%-40% loss to inflation over ten years. Over decades? You could get wiped out if you don’t have fresh money. By the same token, however, ultra risky investments into illiquid assets and friends’ businesses isn’t a good idea either.
So, proper planning + the ability to say no + a realistic attitude to risk = a winning combination.
I guess reading stories about how frequently these “riches to rags” stories are, can motivate people.
All too often people assume these stories are just 1% of the total, which isn’t the case at all.
Most studies show that at least 30% of lottery winners go broke, with some indicating over 50%.
Former sports stars are even more likely to go broke by middle age.

"What are ""middle class millionaires""? Does such a thing truly exist?","https://www.quora.com/What-are-middle-class-millionaires-Does-such-a-thing-truly-exist","2.1K views","14 upvotes","12 shares","","They certainly exist.
There are two primary ways:
The get rich slow kind of millionaires
These are people who have typically only ever earned an average income, but started investing early, and got rich slowly.
People like this cleaner who died with $8m:
Or this secretary who died with a similar amount
They just held onto assets “forever”. They are income-poor or above, but asset rich, unless they turn their assets into cashflow eventually.
2. The more controversial idea.
Most people think being rich is about income. If you earn much more than everybody else, you are “rich”.
Many tax systems have the same assumption as well. In the UK, if you earn over 150k Pounds a year (165,000USD at the time of writing) you pay higher taxes, as you are earning 4x or so more than the average person. In the US, it is $523,601.
Yet just because somebody is earning such amounts, doesn’t mean they are wealthy or have a fundamentally different relationship with assets than the average person - more on that below.
Even if somebody is a multi-millionaire who is worth $5m, and earns 600k a year, in many ways, that person is very upper-middle “class”.
Think about it this way. The gap between somebody earning minimum wage and is in the situation I just mentioned, is smaller than the gap between a billionaire and somebody who is worth $5m, and earning 600k.
A good rule of thumb is this. If somebody can live off their investments/assets comfortable, they are upper-middle “class”.
That person who has $3m and can draw down 90,000 a year is comfortable, but not rich.
In comparison, an investor who can live more than comfortably from assets alone, is more likely to have moved beyond the middle-class.
Either way, to judge somebody on income alone is misleading, as is the word class, which is why I put it in inverted commas.
The biggest indicator is more likely to be the relationship a person has with assets, rather than income or if they run their own business or have a high income.

Tiffany Cole was born in South Carolina in 1981. Her single father had a lot of health problems, and as a teenager, Tiffany was taken under the wing of her neighbors, Reggie and Carol Sumner, a couple in their 50s who treated Tiffany like one of their own children.
In 2005, the Sumners, then both 61, put their home in South Carolina up for sale and retired to Jacksonville, Florida. Tiffany, then 24, visited them often, as she had purchased a car from them and would drive to their home to make payments. On one such visit, accompanied by her new boyfriend, Michael James Jackson, Carol and Reggie happened to mention that they had closed on the sale of the South Carolina home, and made a profit of $99,000. They were thrilled, as the money would help them to remain comfortable in their retirement.
As soon as Tiffany and Michael heard this, they decided that they were going to get their hands on that money.
They enlisted the help of two other men, Alan Wade and Bruce Nixon, to help them carry out their robbery of the Sumners. Wade and Nixon showed up at the Sumners' home, stating that their car had broken down and asking to use the phone. Carol, being a helpful, welcoming person, agreed — as Tiffany had told Wade and Nixon that she would, based on the type of person she knew Carol to be.
Once inside, the two men bound and gagged the couple, both of whom had chronic health issues and were physically frail, then proceeded to ransack the home. When they were done, they stuffed Carol and Reggie into the trunk of the couple's car, and drove them to a remote area across the state line in Georgia, where a grave had been pre-dug.
The Sumners, crying and pleading, were forced into the grave, while their four kidnappers demanded all of their banking information, PIN numbers, etc. It was at this point that they would have seen that Tiffany, a woman they had treated like family, was involved, and I can't imagine the heartbreak and sense of betrayal they must have felt.
Once they had all the information they wanted, Wade and Nixon proceeded to bury Carol and Reggie alive.
Shovelful by shovelful, they filled in the grave. Even after it was completely packed in, the four could hear the sounds of the couple dying. The coroner's report stated that dirt was found in the Sumners' noses, mouths, throats, lungs, and stomachs. This was one of the most agonizing deaths imaginable.
After killing the Sumners, Tiffany and the others went on a spending spree. Here is a photo of Tiffany and Michael celebrating shortly after the murder.
Bruce Nixon was the one who confessed to the police and led them to the Sumners' grave. In return, he was spared the death penalty and sentenced to 45 years. The other three all received death sentences, but in 2017, the Florida Supreme Court ordered new trials for all three, as the original jury had not unanimously recommended the death penalty. All are still currently awaiting new trials.
Tiffany Cole is a monster. How she could so heinously betray the people who treated her with such kindness and generosity, out of sheer greed, is mind-boggling.
Rest in peace, Carol and Reggie.","","",""

"What happens when you receive over a million dollars into your bank account?","https://www.quora.com/What-happens-when-you-receive-over-a-million-dollars-into-your-bank-account","71K views","48 upvotes","6 shares","3 comments","A couple things would ensue if you just walked into a bank ready to deposit $1 million into your account.
First, the teller would probably need a couple seconds to realize you legit just brought a million bucks to a bank. Second, after he/she got themselves together and stopped dreaming about all the things they could do with all that money, their suspicion level would go way, way up. Normal businessmen or rich people don't usually just deposit a whole million into their account. Most people with that much money on hand have separate banks, so you already look like a guilty amateur.
However, if you provide a reasonable explanation on why you have so much money and why you want to deposit it in the bank, 9/10 times (granted you plan on doing this 10 times) the banker will just laugh while he/she deposits the money, and when you leave the bank will file a suspicion report to the U.S. Treasurey. From there, the treasurey will ever so silently start tracking your every dollar and see where it goes to. Now that you're money is under 24/7 surveillance, any illegal transaction will result in a manhunt to have you tracked down and arrested, and then the FBI/Treasurey would seize the money from the bank.
BUT, if it's all LEGAL money that you saved since you were a wee-boy up to where you are now, and simply just feel like depositing the entire million into your account, that's 100% fine and nothing will occur other than a raised eyebrow.
However, there is the slight chance that the banker/teller decides not to allow the deposit. Two things will happen here:
1. They will call the police. Then the police will literally arrest the money, not you but actually the money, until you can prove the money is yours. While this is not common protocol in any means, it can happen.
2. The teller or banker will simply ""delay"" the deposit until a ""higher-up"" can verify it being legit. From a former high-end bank teller:
""I have personally been delayed awaiting manager approval for (non-cash) transactions in the 200K range -- on such occasions, the teller used a particular subtle phrasing which seemed to connote 'This is not an illegal or questionable transaction, it's okay for you (manager) to approve.'""
You see, the bank only really gets suspicious if you aren't paying in cash. If you pay such a high amount through check and it bounces, the bank very well could go bankrupt.
So if you want to deposit a million bucks, to avoid most suspicion, deposit in CASH, make sure you have documentation proving its your cash and you obtained it legally (i.e. taxes are documented as paid, etc.) and you aren't wearing torn pants and a dirty shirt when you go to make the deposit.
In conclusion, the most likely thing to happen is just some raised eyebrows and a report the Treasurey ... If you look the part and pay with cash. But really, everything stated above could happen.","","",""
"Is it possible to become a millionaire without debt?","https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-become-a-millionaire-without-debt","1.1K views","11 upvotes","8 shares","1 comment","It is, but most people actually indirectly get wealthy through debt.
What do I mean by that? Many “everyday millionaires” might think they haven’t got into debt. Maybe they haven’t used credit cards and business debts.
Yet most have made more money from getting a mortgage that buying the property in cash.
The majority have also directly or indirectly (through pensions) invested into the stock market. Those companies use debt to grow.
Debt is a double-edged sword. Leverage increases the gains, but also the risk. Charlie Munger once said there are three ways smart people go broke - liquor, ladies and leverage!
The dangerous thing about leverage is that it works most of the time. Therefore, you might start out sensibly. Once it works, why not go for more and more?
You also need to be right more often as per this quote:
I know several people who went broke during the 2008 financial crisis, as they needed to sell properties to pay back the loans that were called in.
Somebody who would have leveraged out on the indexes like the S&P500 would have also made a fortune in the long-term, but plenty took leverage took far.
So, use debt sensibly. It can be your making, or breaking. You can get it right ninety-nine times out of a hundred, and that one time you fail can be your undoing.
What is true is that most people who get wealthy use different types of leverage, which isn’t just financial leverage.
What kinds of leverage am I referring to?
Financial leverage/debt. We have already discussed that
Leveraging people. Employing others to do tasks for you
Leveraging time. Compound investing returns is a great example of this
Leveraging technology. You can’t be in over a hundred countries at once with the old model. You can be if you are online.
Basically, if you just invest in yourself and gain high skills, it isn’t easy to get wealthy, unless you save really hard.
Even then, inflation might erode the capital. Therefore, investing in time and other kinds of leverage can be very effective.

My wife came to the US in 2015 and her family came in December 2022 and lived in Havana, Cuba their entire lives. They were truly poor by nearly any standard. As a child, the family of 5 lived in a one bedroom, one bathroom house with a fan and boiled hot water for their “shower”. My wife slept next door at her grandmothers house in the same bed as her grandmother. They had nothing of material things but one thing they did have is friendships. Everyone was generally struggling to survive and something you see in Cubans who have been oppressed for 63 years is that they enjoy friendships. Every day, several times per day, friends stop by unannounced.
It’s a very social community. It includes serving a cup of super strong, super sweet Cuban coffee and some juicy gossip about nothing if Importance. Sometimes you will see large huddles of men in a circle and mistake it for a serious brawl about to take place. Emotions are flaring, voices full of emotion and yelling. But relax, they are simply “discussing” baseball! To watch the energy expelled over such a trivial topic gives perspective to what life has been reduced to for Cubans. They barely survive yet they have one thing that most people don’t take the time to enjoy: relationships.","","",""
"Does being rich make you happier?","https://www.quora.com/Does-being-rich-make-you-happier","301.9K views","524 upvotes","25 shares","","Warwick University did an interesting study:
They found that people are happier when they are doing better a little bit better than their neighbors and people they are close to.
The person earning $90,000, who is surrounded by people typically earning $70,000, will often be happier than the person earning $500,000, but surrounded by people earning millions.
Therefore, if you want to be happier, often it makes sense to live in an area below your financial capabilities and not just “trade up” when it comes to property.
Beyond that, money can help to make people happier, if they use the cash in the right way.
For most people that is:
Spending on experiences, especially novel and new ones, versus on things which get old. That new car or iPhone gets old fast. In comparison, most of us remember the first holiday with our kids or spouses.
Giving to others. Countless studies have shown that those who give to good causes have lower levels of stress and anxiety, and this can be shown by comparing blood results and other measures.
Focusing on security as much as things. The sense of being independently wealthy, and able to take a year off or retire early, is more relaxing than always needing to work.
Not comparing yourself with other people and the consumption habits they display. Also, not being pressurised by society to live up to a certain standard. Most wealthy people who still live in the same old house are happier than those who always buy a bigger place.
Focusing on health and our relationships with people around us.
Having some kind of balance in life, even if we work hard.
Buying time in some cases. That could be outsourcing as a business owner or retiring early if you hate your job.
Focusing on hobbies and what you actually enjoy, once wealth has been accumulated. For some this is work. For others, it might be something else.
In comparison, some people get more miserable as they earn more. Those people typically just care about what general society thinks.
The next Instagram picture, showing off, is more important than the actual experience.
When people say that money can’t buy happiness because numerous studies have shown that whilst money makes a big difference at the lower levels, it doesn’t seem to have an effect once people are comfortable and then become very wealthy.
That is partly true but isn’t the whole story. If people use money in the right way, it can make a difference but doesn't buy happiness automatically.
Let’s put this another way, a lack of money indirectly causes many of life’s problems - more chance of divorce, death, and disability.
At least managing money well increases your odds of happiness, if you use it correctly.

My job was to do inventory and I also did some surveillance work since I could be on the sales floor in plain clothes while logging the inventory. One day I saw a co-worker shopping on her day off with her teenage son. It was obvious they didn't have much to spend and she and her son were going through coupons. I heard her tell her son on several occasions to put certain items back because they didn't have a coupon or enough money. I stayed unnoticed and continued working. Later, I saw her at the cashier line and said hi. It was at that time that I noticed she was only buying a few essential items. She was paying mostly in coins. She apologized but then mentioned that was all she had.
The next day at work, we somehow ended up talking about the cost of certain bills we had. It was at that time that she disclosed that she rarely makes enough to pay the bills and sometimes she has to use change from her and her sons piggy banks to buy essential groceries. I thought that was really sad. Since I was in college at the time, working but living in my parents home essentially rent free, when Christmas came around. I anonymously put a Christmas card containing a $50 gift card for the store we worked at in her work mailbox. I never told her it was from me. She was grinning ear to ear that day. I was so glad I was able to help her even though it was not much. Later I learned that she had thought the store handed out bonuses and that everyone had received a gift card.","","",""
"Why do the rich get away with crimes?","https://www.quora.com/Why-do-the-rich-get-away-with-crimes","22.5K views","52 upvotes","1 share","4 comments","Honestly? Because they are in the same social circle as the politicians who make the laws and the prosecutors, judges, etc., and they donate tons of money to those politicians. Plus, since they’re the ones who make the rules and set the penalties, they make punishment very lenient for the types of crimes they commit. Here’s an example of what I’m talking about: a guy knocks down an elderly woman at an ATM machine by grabbing the cash she just withdrew. If he gets caught and he’s poor, he will get a public defender and let’s say the elderly woman’s leg was bruised when he knocked her down. A three year stip in a maximum security prison would be a reasonable sentence to expect (Oh, and a stip means he actually has to spend the whole three years in prison, no parole) And the type of prison I’m talking about is the kind you see in movies; shanks, fights, gangs, all that, so he isn’t going to have much fun.
Now, same elderly woman, but this time her financial adviser embezzles three million dollars, her life savings, her leaving her destitute with no money to pay for her home, food, medical expenses, etc. To the point where, before he embezzled the money she had a nice condo, a car, and that sense of comfort from knowing she had more than enough money in the bank to carry her through the rest of her life. And now she will be a ward of the state, spending her remaining years in a crowded government run nursing home. If her financial adviser is caught and convicted he might spend a few months or a year in a minimum security, and if his lawyer is good, a federal prison that has a jogging track, basketball courts, library and many of the other comforts of home.
Is that fair? Who really hurt the elderly woman more: the guy who grabbed twenty dollars from her hand and bruised her leg, or the guy who stole her life savings and destroyed her life.
Actually I tried to trick you. The reason I said the financial adviser could expect to spend a few month or a year in prison was just a way for me to show the difference between the prisons where rich people go and the prisons everyone else go. In real life - and I’m not making this up - for the crime committed by the financial advisor, the theft of three million dollars, Lets say he’s thirty-eight years old, wife, kids, etc, this is his first offense, I would not be in the least bit surprised if it was, in fact I would expect his sentence to be something like a hefty fine and community service, and of course restitution to the elderly woman which his lawyer will delay using legal ploys to tie the matter up in court until she finally dies.","","",""
"What is wealth to you?","https://www.quora.com/What-is-wealth-to-you","2.6K views","123 upvotes","6 shares","13 comments","What is wealth to me? It’s a tool to achieve what I want. It’s also kinda make-believe… No - I don't mean I’m broke, I mean the whole concept of being wealthy (in some instances) is kinda sleight of hand.
You see, we have a property portfolio. Property in New Zealand is quite expensive... As in ‘lot’s of zero’s’ expensive. We have quite a few properties meaning we have quite a few zero’s BUT, the zero’s aren’t ‘real’ until the property is actually sold and its value realised.
Let’s say someone has 5 million dollars in property in New Zealand (that’s just like… 5 houses in Auckland 😏- **also, avoid AKl for residential-property investment) and the property market in NZ dives by 40% then what that means is that someone's paper value of 5 million has just had their net worth effectively drop to 3 million (losing 2 million in equity) and the person hasn't even lifted a finger and is probably still making the same returns (depending on how they have their portfolio leveraged) and is only really affected if they want to borrow based on their net worth.
Let’s say someone had a property portfolio of 2 million and the same thing happened… They go from being a ‘multi-millionaire’ to … well… not being one. It’s a hollow title. (Pointless sidenote: You need a net wealth of 3.86m to qualify as NZ's top 1%).
Stocks are much the same. Ditto for bullsh!t like bitcoin. Look at FTX tokens:
Image source: link
People went from imaginary billionaires to very real broke-a$$ paupers.
When you start playing in this area, it’s at this point that you start to realize that ‘wealth’ and big money are often nothing more than a hollow facade based on what people think things are worth (at any given moment).
In addition to that, interestingly, the genuinely wealthy people I know look like the most broke people on the planet (driving old utes and wandering around barefoot) whereas some others I know (who buy the latest cars and accessories and rent very large houses) are actually super broke and leveraged up to the eyeballs.
Wealth is often nothing more than 3 card monte. No one should be respected just because they're ‘wealthy’ or disrespected just because they might appear broke.","","",""

A woman appeared behind them so he asked for his friend. She calls him and he comes to the door, peeling kids back so he can open it.

But, being honest, I am not as upset about it as some others.
Firstly, I am not a big fan of drinking at sport events. After? Sure. Before? Sometimes. But when you are there, watch the footie. The more you drink the more bathroom breaks you are going to need anyhow. Now, just because that is my preference I don’t necessarily think I should impose it on everyone else, but I am just saying: a fair number of fans are not going to miss it. In the UK alcohol is already banned in all football stadiums and has been for as long as I can remember. Somehow we all survive.
Secondly, the stated reason by Qatar is because they thought alcohol at stadiums would make some fans uncomfortable. Assuming that really is the reason, it certainly isn’t the worst reason in the world. Try to keep a friendly atmosphere and dial back on the public drunkenness in a conservative country - I can see that.
Thirdly, it is not like there isn’t plenty of alcohol available outside of stadiums. I can’t imagine that was an easy thing for the Qataris to get their heads around, so at least we got that.
Whilst it is definitely not brilliant having a change like this so close to the kick off, I suspect people are upset because (i) they are unhappy at Qatar anyhow, and it is another stick to beat them with, and (ii) if you excuse the metaphor, last minute changes like that are indicative of an inability to organise a piss up in a brewery, much less manage the world’s largest sporting event.","","",""

There is no federal property tax.
Joe Biden is not raising property taxes because there is no federal property tax. The President has no say in and no control over property taxes because property taxes are local, not federal.
Same for rent control. Rent control laws are not set by the President because there are no federal rent control laws. Rent control is local, not federal.

Friend of a guy I worked with in Atlanta did. Back in the late 90s/early 2000s, apparently knitters started discovering the joys of alpaca wool. I have no idea why, or what’s special about it—I know fuckall about knitting—but apparently to some people alpaca wool is a big deal.
Problem is, there weren’t any alpaca farms in the US at the time that operated on a large scale, they were all little mom and pop shops that owned, like, five alpacas or something. So you couldn’t go into Bob’s Knitting Mart or Hobby Depot or Yarn R Us or wherever you go to buy yarn and just buy alpaca wool.
So he set up a website that was kind of like eBay for knitters. I did a little bit of front-end work on it, bringing it from about 1997-era design to about 2001-era design. It was a pretty awful site, but it became the place for people to go who wanted alpaca wool, place where those little mom and pop alpaca farms could find people who wanted to buy the wool, and my friend’s friend got a percentage of every sale.

How much is Putin really worth? No one knows. He puts money into accounts belonging to family members or trusted associates. And then there’s this:
According to the jailed Navalny, that $1.4 BILLION palace belongs to Putin. It’s in Sochi, where Putin made a bomb selling off land he personally owned to developers involved with the 2014 Olympics. And builders have confirmed many of the construction details cited by Navalny.

Last year he got a roughly 20 million exit from a Location Intelligence company, and went on to join a Cybersecurity & defense contractor in Atlanta as their CTO under a 9 million agreement. I have not seen any change in his lifestyle. One thing I admire about him is that he keeps a low profile and participates in philanthropy. If you talk to him, you will never know he’s worth a lot more than 50 million. As a child adoption advocate he believe’s a dollar tomorrow has no value if it can help someone today. That’s deep! In a world where 99% of the rich donate a portion of their wealth after death, € believe there’s no point waiting.
While people like him are outliers, I am more of a conservative and I achieved my humble goal of generating $200K a year in retirement income in 2016, and am now shooting for $300K a year in order to comfortably take care of my two little ones and a 3rd on on the way. I manage that with stock market investments, rental income and a couple of book royalties. While I am not in the 50 million club with €, I am hoping to get there half way through in another 20 yrs if markets were to continue behaving as they have been in the past 10 yrs :-)
Hopefully this answers your question.","","",""

What if you are given $100 billion but 100 years to live? Will you take it?
I would not.
Not because I expect to live longer. Of course not!
But regardless of what the number of years is, you have a fixed expiry date. You know how time much is left, and it will feel like a death sentence. A deferred one, but a death sentence nevertheless.
But what about the amount? Is $100 billion not big? Should that not matter?
$100 billion or $100 million does not matter. From the utility point of view, it is practically the same after a point. Once you can eat well, travel, take care of your health and education needs, pay your gym membership, and have a nice house to live in, rest is effectively just ‘Monopoly Money’. It is a number - nice to look at, but of not much practical utility.
But can’t you buy a palatial house with 34 bedrooms on an island? Yes, you can. But try sleeping in 34 bedrooms simultaneously, and you will see what fun it is. Or try sleeping in a new bedroom every night. I bet, at that point, you would be more worried about getting sound sleep than bedroom selection.
Will I take a deferred death sentence for $100 billion? No. Not for Monopoly Money.","","",""

Her uncle was itching to buy a lot in a new subdivision to build a house. He bought two lots and began building. He offered to sell his old house “at the family rate” to SIL once his new one was completed.
The “family rate” turned out to be market rate. But she wasn’t upset about not getting a discount.
He had planted a tree in the yard just before he decided to build a new house. Once he moved and realized he had no trees, he looked into buying the same kind to plant around his new house. The price had gone up.
What’s a guy to do when he’s spent so much on the land and house and furniture that he can’t afford the expensive tree he wants to plant?
Several months after SIL’s family moved in, her uncle returned, telling her the newest tree wasn’t part of the sale, dug it up out of her yard, and moved it across town to his new house.
He had spent months bragging to the whole family about how generous he was to help out his niece. She’s a bit timid anyway. She didn’t want a huge family stink, so said nothing until 10+ years later when we had a discussion about real estate sales.

In fact, I read a lot of stuff about government existing to secure and protect our rights, and among our rights are private property rights. In other words, the right to the fruits of our labor. It would seem to me that a government that arbitrarily decides to take from some and give to others is simply trampling our rights, not protecting them.
Far too many don’t understand that the compelling thing about America is that we’re founded on the idea that government exists to protect our natural rights. We have a society organized around the idea that our individual freedoms and individual liberties are central to civil society.
The American approach stands in stark contrast to nations based on various flavors of Marxist philosophy where the individual’s rights are subordinated to the needs of the State. In that form of government, the individual exists to serve the State, and such a nation might indeed bother itself with actively distributing wealth as the elite see fit so as to enrich themselves and their favored groups.
Here in America, every patriotic American should be disgusted by the idea that some believe government should distribute wealth according to its whims.","","",""

Because of my work, I get to know a lot of wealthy people. Most buy mainstream brands and primarily look at utility and safety first. They are not likely to buy the smallest car they can find, but rather something large and safe. It varies a bit by geography. Here in the Midwest, around here it would be a Ford 150 pickup as the first choice or a large SUV. In the Pacific Northwest, it would be a Lexus, BMW X5, or a Ford Explorer or something in that range.
It’s a tiny niche of car enthusiasts that would buy a Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc. Yes, you see a lot of Range Rovers, and the like, but most fly under the radar and don’t want the attention. They have nothing to prove and are secure with their wealth and just want to get around without people noticing.
They don’t buy used because of reliability concerns and they go through cars about every three years, often on a lease, where they just keep replacing cars, frequently sight unseen.","","",""

How bad Is it???

How bad is it to live in Czechia?Seriously bad. I don't understand why anyone would live in this wasteland in the middle of Central Europe!!! 1 2 The empty main town square in small central bohemian town Kouřim where all locals committed mass suicide because they realized their really pathetic existence. These events are quite common since the author posts this question here in Quora… They can not live in such a terrible place anymore… We suffer under prosperity, developed system of social security, very good universal health care and education. We have a problem with low criminality and extremely low violent criminality. 3 Awful maternity clinic where the daughter of my boss was born a couple of days ago. His wife suffers under world-class experts and it was covered by damn mandatory health insurance! I am so surprised they survived! 4 We have damn social protection and system of public transport literally everywhere and terribly low social differences compare to other developed countries… 5 We have to survive four seasons :( 6 Most of us have to live in awful old houses that we haven't demolish yet. Moreover more than 80 % of us own (at least) house or flat where we live and own summer houses, farm land or another properties are very common too. You know, poor people… 7 You could expect. “Guys, If your past so sucks, present/future will be better”… no, It´s awful too. 8 We discovered fire last year and hopefully, the electricity will come very soon to our houses, maybe next year… (the street where I live) 9 We have awful national parks, natural reserves and wait for it!!!! Gardens everywhere, so depressive gardens and people who do not have gardens have often awful flowers. 10 And I almost forget Czechs are terribly educated people who love friends, hobbies, pets so generally speaking total trashy part of the human race. 11 Czechs are so boring, lazy and terrible people. They don´t do anything interesting just drink beer and eat schnitzels… 12 Czech society is generally speaking so backward so we imprisoned and burned people with magic electronic boxes yesterday (they called it cellphones) 13 Everyone really cares, if you are Christian, Atheist or Jew. It´s such a serious topic that most locals didn´t answer a religion question in regular national survey… It´s so bad, no fights between people because of religion… 14 People enjoy so much freedom. No!!! 15 Locals are so racist and xenophobic. I don´t know what we do first? Maybe push my Indian flatmate under a tram. Break shop window of Italian bistro near my office. I could punch a Ukrainian shop assistant from the local supermarket or attack Vietnamese who run fast food in our street or I can choose from so many tourists! Or should I focus on gays/lesbians, handicapped people, feminists, redhead? There are so many options and millions of attacks everyday… 16 We don't have heating in our houses so we have to make an open fire on the floor and find anything that burns. I found this room full of paper and parchment… some old garbage again… I don´t have to look for wood anymore! 17 This land is so terrible that the number of foreigners who live here rises every year. People from other countries hate this land so much that tens of thousands of foreign students want to study in our schools and a lot of them stay there after graduation and this awful place visit more foreign tourists than the population of the country every year. 18 We have over-filled deposits by old garbage everywhere…you know museums, galleries, librariers, art centers, theaters… useless! 19 Tens of thousands of us have to work in labs and design studios and millions of others in offices or shops like slaves :/ 20 We suffer under the lowest unemployment in the EU and we have to spend our money in shops and buy nonsenses… 21 Many of us suffer during hiking and cycling or other sports. I am going to go to a trip and I don't know If I survive tomorrow! 22 Local nature is extremely dangerous and there are disasters every day. You can not go to nature because It´s so risky :(. For example, several of my relatives were killed by roebucks :/ 23 We face huge challenges every day. For example what kind of ice cream we will get! I got lemon but It was practically a life challenge! I am so proud of me. #firstworldproblems 24 We suffer… a lot, because except for all possible international cuisines, all types of meats, fruits, and the food we have to eat local cuisine too. It´s very similar like Austrian or Bavarian (South German) cuisine… awful… 25 Politicians just talk and discuss… you know unitary parliamentary democracy… no, a strong leader or leading party that solves everything… It sucks! 26 Locals news have so serious stories like stuck people in an elevator or reconstruction of highway D1 (No, It's seriously a nightmare…) 27 Who wanna live in such a terrible place like this? Make career, start a family, bringing up kids and get old. I don´t so I wanna definitely emigrate somewhere else. So I will load my stuff on my horse and leave this hell forever! 28 Man! I hate this land so much!!!! *Facepalm* hope, everybody understands I am sarcastic…I hope so :D If you wanna know more about life in our tiny hell check links below or ask me in the comment section: Vojta Rod's answer to What is it like to live in Czechia?

Vojta Rod's answer to Why is Czechia such a safe country? Vojta Rod's answer to What are some things people get wrong about your country? Have you ever thought of hell? I see it every day! XD 29 Note mainly for non-European users: You don´t know but A lot of your imagination about Europe is based on Czech Republic/Czechia. Why? 30 Hundreds of global movies, series and commercials were made there. CZ often cover other European location from movie Casino Royale or The Chronicles of Narnia, music clips of Linkin Park or Kaney West to commercials of Apple, HTC or Sony…. Apple loves CZ… a lot… 31 One old legend even claims that Czechia doesn't exist and It's just a huge movie decoration... Maybe … more in the video below… You maybe noticed, Czech municipalities look very historical and yes, you are right. It has four major reasons. First, two are connected mainly to history - Czech lands were one of the less damaged areas in Europe during WW2 and despite extensive damage and decline of the country during USSR occupation, buildings mostly gradually fell apart during this age but we prefer reconstruction/rebuilding so we save literally ruined buildings/districts from demolition. Another reason is a very strict law that protects historic buildings and finally kind of Czech “traditional” attitude to architecture. 32 Czechia is quite a small country but for your better imagination. This is the map of town/city protected reservations (strict protection) and zones (little bit less strict protection). These are not just a single building or complex but whole urban areas. There are more than 600 cities, towns, villages, landscapes, and archeological areas with this special type of extra protection. Random example - Manětín (Pilsen region, Western Bohemia) General description: A unique document of the baroque concept of the town with landscape connections. An untouched composition of a terraced square, the south side of which forms the chateau. Significant are the untouched Baroque and late Baroque buildings, sacral architecture, and rich sculptural decoration. So finally, guys without any primitive nationalism or optimism. Locals are so lucky because there are not so many countries with similar or better conditions that we have there. The majority of the world could just dream about the standards and possibilities we have. So I feel damn lucky, I was born there. I'm my biggest limit… Description of pics: 1. Sand “dune” near Vlkov village, 0,8 hectare located in South Bohemia 2. Prague-Podolí Maternity Hospital opened in 1914 3. A grammar school in Znojmo 4.

John Connally was Governor of Texas in 1963. A conservative Democrat, Connally was riding in the open car in Dallas on the fateful date November 22, 1963.
He was struck by one of Lee Harvey Oswald’s bullets.
Connally would later become a supporter of Richard Nixon.
Nixon named John Connally Treasury Secretary.
Connally switched to the GOP in 1973. He ran for President in 1980, spent $12 million and managed to win a single delegate.
After his failed presidential campaign, Connally decided to see if he could use money to make more of it. He partnered with another former Texas politician, Ben Barnes.
By 1983, the two had invested some $200 million in oil and real estate including shopping malls, condominiums, and office buildings. Alas, oil prices tanked and Texas real estate tanked as well.
Connally was forced to declare bankruptcy with debts initially of $93 million though by the beginning of 1988, the debts were estimated at $48 million. He was forced to sell his Austin house, his horses, many businesses, and antique art collection.
Connally did not exactly end up in poverty - he managed to make a living by using all of his many political contacts to call in favors and open doors for others - at a price. But his high life was over.","","",""

I saw a nice looking, 2 door coupe on a car lot - the price was $6800. I only wanted to spend $3000, so I kept looking. The car looked nice, though, so over the summer I kept driving by the lot. Every month the price dropped $1000 until it was $4800. I needed a car also at that time because I was driving 1000 miles a week and my Plymouth had 175,000 miles on it, my Chevy had 165,000 miles on it, and my Ford had 235,000 miles on it. I wanted a Honda with around 100,000 miles and a manual transmission. I figured I could get one for around $3000 and since they routinely run 200,000+ miles, I’d be set for a cheap, reliable commuter. I had test driven several cars at this lot for the stepson, but they all had major issues (suspension, wheel bearings, things I didn’t have time to fix). I test drove the little, black car. It had a six speed manual, 115,000 miles, a Honda motor and was quick! The suspension was tight, the brakes were new, it had a few minor issues, but when I took it on the test drive, I also checked the blue book value. It was supposed to be $8400. I drove back to the dealer and asked why the price was so low. He told me he didn’t know it was a manual transmission and, apparently, in this town, no one knew how to drive a manual transmission so he just kept lowering the price until he got to what he paid for it. He was pissed because he put new rotors and pads on it, and a new windshield. I was happy and bought it. I went to the gas station to top off the tank and it said premium fuel only. I googled the car and realized I had bought an Acura RSX Type-S - an entry level sports car that has a sub-6 second 0–60, 142mph top end, 210HP for a 2500lb car. My plans for my commuter car now are tuned suspension, larger injectors, beefy clutch, and 9–14psi boost - My commuter will, hopefully, become a 2500lb, 400HP rice rocket for about $4000 more than the car should have cost stock.","","",""

Time. And you might think Rolex. Meh.
My most expensive watch is a zany little Franc Mueller. I set a goal to be able to buy it. Which was nice. But it never leaves my bedroom, so what’s the point of having it at all?
Even when I was earning money like a madman, I had the simple Timex
at the top. Still wear it.
(Though, I guess I’ve been wearing a smartwatch for about 6 months. I’m… torn. I like having the data. But, I just want the simplicity of a watch.)
No, I mean actual time.
Watches are just stuff. Cars are stuff. Houses are just places. But your personal inventory of time is depleting rapidly. If you want to do anything, you better start protecting your limited supply of time.
I don’t have as much money as I once did, by far. But I do remember how money made life easier. And today? I would use much of that to reclaim my time.
A personal assistant? A good PA is really life-changing. Some of my friends in NYC lament their PA—usually a series of multiple PAs—endlessly. It’s because they don’t know what they’re doing and they don’t really value what a good PA can do for them. They think they can pay something like $36,000 as a salary for a PA, and that’s just $#@^ing absurd. If you are rich, a good—and trustworthy—PA is worth his or her weight in gold. If you can pay for that, you should happily do so. (And this is before we start talking about family offices, which I think is a bit beyond the question.)
A personal shopper? Ugh, please. Errands. I hate sundry errands. It turns into analysis paralysis for me. It’s worth money to me to have the decision in progress, and to then to make the decision about the result. I will trust your judgment. Please, go do it!
A private chef? Absolutely. I love to cook, but it is terribly time-consuming. An ever-changing schedule makes it even more difficult. And there is the risk, that you eat poorly. And so, it’s not just time-management but becomes a health management. If you can, you might happily pay someone to feed you like a barnyard animal.
A gardener? I love my garden. I find enjoyment in keeping it and all the fresh things that come out of it. But, let’s be real. It takes time. And as some scale, it becomes unmanageable. Personally, I would much rather employ someone to keep it running, so that I can have the benefits of it regularly and still enjoy it when I want to.
The salary for a part-time gardener is about the same as a new Rolex. Which would I care more about? Pfff.","","",""

Edit 1:—
Whooaah! Never expected that my answer would have 22k+ views and counting!
Now coming to the comments
Some moral police have advised me that this is clearly wastage of money, as I should have invested this money or give it to the needy and either I am earning 20k or not more than 1 lac in any case and only he can earn this much by trading 😂, and have bought this phone just to show off!
Let me clear few things for you
1.Talking about my earnings:—
I am a full time Salesforce Developer , which is basically a niche technology to work on
In the morning time I give sessions on Salesforce and Data visualization using EA , for many online learning platforms like mindmajix, gologica. I can easily purchase this phone by giving few sessions only.
After that let me come to my freelancing work, there are few android and Salesforce projects are going on under my supervision!
Now you can make assumptions about my earning😊
And yeah let me remind you one thing, if you really feel that a job doesn't pay you good amount, then you must have not been passionate about the work you did at your job!
2. Wastage of money ?
If you buy something you love and you admire alot and you can afford it, this is not a wastage of money at all
I am not that type of a guy who buy new phone every year, or even every two years.
I have bought a new phone almost after 5 years!!!
Yes you read that right!!
3 . Why this phone only ?
First of all, this phone has solved many problems which I used to face earlier.
Writing with a stylus, convert that to pdf
No camera came close to its zooming capabilities plus the quality of photos are just amazing.
Talking about, one plus?
They have the worst cameras ,for a flagship phones.
Secondly, I am fan of hardwares.
This piece of beauty is worth the money.
May it be great cameras
size of the screen
Quality of the screen
Feel in hand
samsung dex
3 years of software update as promised by samsung
And last but not the least which made me pick this phone
Is the current android project which we are working on, similar to DocuSign.
This device is helping us alot on that.
4. Why not iphone 12 pro ??
If you are paying this much of amount, you need latest features to be present on your device.
Iphone lacks all of these
In display finger print
Curves super amoled screen with hdr
Zoom capabilities
Screen size
Stylus to do dozens of things
Iphone is far behind in terms of features
5 Giving to the needy ?
This is the thing which is in between me and my almighty, so I don't want to brag about this here
Giving valuable advice is a good thing, but if your advice is based on so many assumptions then clearly you need to inculcate your words.
Edit 2:—
Wow, 130k+ views and 2.2k+upvotes, that's huge!
Whoever is asking me about my profession , about Salesforce, Einstein analytics and about data visualization , can directly ping me for that! We can have a discussion over that , definitely!
Edit 3:- views are cruising to 200k ! Cheers

What is the most expensive item you've ever bought?My Hyundai venue sx Imt, so this is the most expensive thing i have bought independently on my own. And let me tell you one thing, this is the first time in my entire family (which consists of 250–300 people) that anybody has bought a brand new car. So Yeah it was moment of proud for my parents and relatives as well. As i can't make them fit all at once in my car, but i still try to fit 2–3 people extra in my car whenever i go somewhere , so that soon everybody will have an experience that how does it feel to cruise in a brand new SUV. Yeah its a big thing for us!!! People criticize me alot for my choice, that you should have gone for tata or mahindra instead. But i am satisfied with my purchase. Talking about the reasons why i have picked Hyundai over tata and mahindra?? 1. Looks of venue attracts me more as compared to nexon or xuv300 (i know that is subjective ) 2. Far Better after sales service of Hyundai as compared to tata and mahindra (they have worst, if you dont believe ask from there owner and go to owner's experience on YouTube) 3. Better coverage of service centers of hyundai 4. Better return value of hyundai cars( hyundai and Maruti suzuki cars value just dont broke at all, but totally oppositein case of tata and mahindra. To verify this, go to olx or any used car app! You'll get to know) 5. Low maintenance as compared to mahindra 6. Interior of venue is best, or i can say better than nexon or xuv300 7. Better availability of spare parts Although nexon and xuv300 are great products in every aspects as well, and we have some good things too in nexon or mahindra But those pros were not the deal breaker for me.Thats why i picked venue and i am totally satisfied with my purchase. I hope people don't bash me this time ,like they did in my last answer for buying an expensive phone by making tons of assumptions and this time for my choice.

I moved far from the Seattle area in the hunt for exactly what I found. I wouldn’t trade this place for anything. I spent four months of intense searching, driving over 13,000 miles to find just the exact right house.
For me it came down to one very important thing. I wanted to find a place where I thought I could do my best work. Pushing myself to be better at what I do matters on a very personal level. I advise companies and leaders all over the world and so geography isn’t as important as it once was. What mattered to me was my overall quality of life and my personal productivity. I wanted to get away from the chaos and noise and into someplace that felt like a retreat every day, where I could think through and solve difficult problems and write in my spare time.
The one thing I ask myself over and over is why I didn’t do this sooner? I would drive to a big city and back to commute to this place in a heartbeat! You can’t find this in a city.

Don't tell your children. The fewer people know the better.
Leave the money there for six months. If the sellers come back to claim it, give it to them.
If some thug comes looking for it, give it to him.
Try to learn about the history of the house to see whether anyone used to live there is currently in jail. If so, that's trouble. Don't touch the money. I'm thinking whoever hid the money might have died unexpectedly without informing any family members. In that case, you're safe.
After six months, get another safe and find another place to keep the money, and dispose the old safe altogether. If someone comes back asking for it, say you know nothing about it. Maybe the sellers took it or someone else could have gotten to it before you, a contractor, the home inspector, etc. So many people have come through the house, you don't know who.
Then go and buy reloadable American Express or Visa gift cards where you can refill with cash at a local store, like CVS - not the same one every time. Don't load too much into the cards, maybe $200-$300 at a time. Basically all your expenses from this point are paid with gift cards. Don't carry too much cash with you. It's dangerous. Use gift cards instead.
That's being said, don't run back to the safe too often. Take out $10k at a time, divide it up among your family members and each should have a safe place to keep the money.
For your job, don't do direct deposit into your bank, get a paycheck for every pay period. When you deposit that check, attach a random amount of cash, less than your paycheck or a little higher but not much, so it wouldn't seem weird.
Then every 4-7 months, deposit a random amount between $7k-$10k into your bank, never the exact amount like $7k or $10k, and never whole dollars. So it should be like $7023.94. If you're married and each of you have two bank accounts, that's an addition $60k or so a year to pay toward your mortgage.
If you have a side business where you get paid with checks and cash (one of my friends bartenders for fun), you can attach some more cash whenever you deposit.
Once you have a decent amount of money in the bank, either buy a couple rental properties or pay off your mortgage. Please consider it a gift and don't squander it.","","",""
"What would happen if everyone would become rich?","https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-everyone-would-become-rich","18.8K views","95 upvotes","3 shares","1 comment","Haha Good question.
It isn't practically possible.
Let's prove it by contradiction.
If everybody becomes rich, who would drive taxis and cabs. Who would mine precious metals and minerals.
In short, the economy would collapse. See, money is just a token. It has no absolute value. If everyone becomes rich ,the currency would have no value.
The value of currency is given by goods and services in the nation. The total goods + services = Relative value of money.
For example,
If their is only one apple in the country because nobody is working hard to produce it, because everybody has money.
Now, if everybody has million dollars, Who would get that one apple.You would have to fight with everyone. The one who pays highest would get the apple.
It would turn out that you bought an apple for a million dollars 💵💲💲.
Does that make sense?? You are still getting the same 1$ apple for a million.
Only ways somebody can become richer is by providing that worth of services and goods ,that is how they earn money.
That is what entrepreneurs do, they use people and guide them to create goods and services for millions of people.Now, the amount of knowledge, hardwork, and discipline is required to run a company makes it difficult to everyone to become rich. But everybody cannot be rich simultaneously as explained above.
The poor people and middle class people run the majority of nation's work.
Ambani's themselves don't go and fixed the damaged mini cable. These little works are most important and are done by common people.
So how to become rich?? BE A GOOD LEADER WITH IMMENSE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVERYTHING.
Rich people are just very good managers and visionary leaders, who guides people on a dark lonely path by risking their own life. That is why they are paid the most.
We as a common citizen are entitled to work hard and smart to create more amount of goods and services. For benefit of both ourselves and nation.We are entitled to earn and spend money.
If you are working hard for yourself, at the same time you may be helping millions of people getting ease of life.
That is also a trick that government uses. In developing countries such as india 🇮🇳, They have high inflation ,meaning that the prices keep on increasing steadily so as to keep the people working hard which indirectly benefit the country. (Also taxes paid by the people when they earn is important for nation).
Edit: Everyone can become rich at some point of their life time , but not simultaneously.
Let's say , a lot of old people become rich, then it is fine, they already have served the country well and have worked all through their life. Young people at the same time would take the responsibility on their shoulders because they are just getting started.
Conclusion: People can become rich but they should provide that much worth of goods and services .
I think this is enough, I don't want to go in too much details.

Be yourself: People can tell when you're faking it. Life isn't the same as high school. Acquire the ability to be at ease in your own flesh.
Smile: anytime you talk to people. Speak clearly and make your message clear.
Ask questions: Question that begins with “why” works best. Let people discover themselves when talking to you.
Be very knowledgeable, try as much as you can to have deep knowledge on different topics.
Speak only when it’s necessary and always make sense with valid points.
Don’t complain: Don’t bawl about how this sucks and that isn’t fair. This won’t get you anywhere in life. And quality people won’t like to be around you.
Be encouraging: Genuinely help and encourage people to do better. You will feel good doing it. And people will like you more.
Use Your hands while having a conversation: Using Your hands will make you comfortable and highly presentable while having a conversation.
Don’t gossip: Quality people don’t gossip. They don’t need to put other people down to feel good about themselves.
Wear clean shoes. Don’t just wear anything but dress with sense! Appearance matters a lot, the way you make yourself presentable is how people are going to treat you.
Boost your confidence by always learning new stuff every day. If you can afford it, travel as much as you can.
Don’t compare yourself with anybody. Do your own thing in your own way, invent your own style.
Memorize peoples name and avoid using ‘Hey’ to address people all the time. You can do this by repeating peoples name constantly anytime you’re having a conversation with them.
Be humble: Nobody likes an all-time show-off. Yes, you are good enough but you don’t need to shove it in people’s faces.
Be very kind. Always have some kind of genuine solutions to other people problems.

Property taxes fund education for elementary and secondary schools on a provincial basis. This means that all schools in the province receive the same amount of money for each student. There are no poor schools, or bad school districts. City kids, rural kids, tech city kids and farm kids get the same education.
Payrol and consumer taxes fund our universities and colleges. Our tuition is considerably lower and more affordable than United states post secondary without sacrificing standards or the value of the degree.
Personal, payroll and consumer taxes fund our retirement plans: our Canada Pension Plan, Old age security, guaranteed income supplement.
Personal, payroll and consumer tax fund our social programs: unemployment insurance, maternity leave, parental leave, unemployed sick benefits, child tax credits, social service (welfare) CPP disability to name just a few.
Personal, payroll and consumer taxes fund our universal health care, our seniors and childrens prescription drug plan, our low income assisted drug plan, our assisted medical device plan and fund our hospitals, blood and imaging support labs. When we're sick or hurt we don't worry about cost. If we lose our job, or quit a job, we don't worry about our families health. We have no pre existing conditions.
As with most societies, the taxes also pay for roads, police, fire departments, courts, municipal offices and city halls as well as other critical infrastructures.
We make choices.
We elect our government, choosing from up to five political parties. We also elect our provincial representative and our town or city mayor and councillors. These are the only elections.
We don't elect police, judges, county clerks, dog catchers or water treatment plant staff, these are all filled by professionals who are not motivated by their next election.
Our choices reflect the value we place on equality. Everyone is entitled to the same level of service in all parts of their civil life.
Do we get cranky about taxes sometimes? We sure do, but talk about cutting back on these services and and the government would be replaced very quickly! You would suddenly see polite Canadians become rude and unruly.
Choices, equality, fairness, representing the will of the citizens, that's how we afford taxes!","","",""

Moreover the world judges them by what they do, speak or write and not by what they wear. So, in one line, they don't care!
On what kind of decisions a person spends his/her time tells us a lot about the persons mindset. Billionaires always like making high impact decisions.
Lets have a look on some statements from some really influential personalities.
Mark Zuckerberg
was asked, ""Why do you wear the same T-shirt every day?""
He answered:
""I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community,"" Zuckerberg said, after clarifying that he has ""multiple same shirts.""
He said even small decisions like choosing what to wear or what to eat for breakfast could be tiring and energy consuming, and he doesn't want to waste any time on that.
""I'm in this really lucky position, where I get to wake up every day and help serve more than a billion people. And I feel like I'm not doing my job if I spend any of my energy on things that are silly or frivolous about my life,"" he said.
Zuckerberg pointed out that a number of other influential people, like Apple founder Steve Jobs or President Barack Obama, have the same theory with regards to choosing their outfits. Jobs, in fact, told Walter Isaacson in his biography that he even wanted to have all Apple employees wear the same vest.
Barack Obama
“You’ll see I wear only gray or blue suits,” “I’m trying to pare down decisions. I don’t want to make decisions about what I’m eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.” He mentioned research that shows the simple act of making decisions degrades one’s ability to make further decisions.

King Nebuchadrezzar II, better known as Nebuchadnezzar (reigned from 605-561 BC), enriched the capital city with the plunder of conquered kingdoms such as Assyria, Judah and Phoenicia.
The intentionally impressive, gold and cobalt Ishtar Gate is one of the best-known relics of his reign, giving us a glimpse into the grandiose architecture of the city during that time.
Nebuchadrezzar's Babylon contained three palaces decorated with glazed, colored brick (the material used in the city's important structures, such as the Ishtar Gate), with blue and yellow glazed tile, and possibly terraced gardens with watering canals, as well as several religious shrines, adorned with sculpture, gold, silver and precious stones.
Nebuchadrezzar also rebuilt a famous ziggurat (a traditional Babylonian and Assyrian pyramidal monument tower) called the Etemenanki, which stood nearly 300 feet (91 m) high—about the height of the Statue of Liberty—with a 91 meter (300 ft) square base. (In Sumerian, “etemenanki” means “Temple of the foundation of heaven and earth”.)
The Processional Way, another of Nebuchadrezzar's proudest accomplishments, was a 70 ft (21 m) wide limestone-paved road that led from the temple of the Babylonian god Marduk through the city's Ishtar Gate. The ceremonial road was almost a half mile (0.8 km) long and was bordered on either side for its length by 50 foot (15.2 m) brick walls, trimmed with gold and decorated with images of flowers, bulls, lions and dragons.
The “Great City” supposedly contained one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon (whose existence and location remain a subject of doubt and dispute among historians and archeologists): Terraced Persian-style gardens constructed for Nebuchadrezzar's Median queen as a gift, whose mysterious irrigation technology and beauty were of renown—-at least according to ancient Greek historians.

The first thing to clarify regarding the poverty mindset definition is that it’s not about how much money a person has in their bank accounts. It’s entirely due to thoughts and perceptions, which, in turn, shape someone’s decisions and beliefs.
Someone with a poverty mindset sees a surplus in resources as an opportunity for increased consumption, and they often center their efforts on making immediate positive changes.

"Why do you support Communism?","https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-support-Communism","24.6K views","544 upvotes","3 shares","","I don't, but I can easily see why it had an appeal in some quarters.
Imagine it's about 1860 or so and you're a peasant on a tenant farm. You're actually a serf, bound to the land and not permitted to take up any other profession. All the land is owned by rich landowners. They take a percentage of your crop as rent, although they do none of the labor to make it grow. They can take whatever percentage they want, even if in years of drought it leaves you so little that your children starve. The government is corrupt and controlled entirely by and for the benefit of the landlords. Because of your status as a peasant, you may not even be allowed to vote. The church also demands 10% as a tithe. If you don't pay, you may go to hell because you didn't receive the last rites or be buried in consecrated ground. You have no other skills that you can sell. Banding together with others to ask for more money, unionizing, is a death penalty offense. Your life is utterly constrained. You may even be illiterate. Your son may be taken (depriving you of his labor) to fight a war you don't even understand. Worse yet, some of your grain may be seized for the war effort. The farthest you will ever travel in your life is 20 kilometers.
Now you hear a rumor of a great worldwide movement to replace all this. The peasants will own the land and run the government. Everyone would be allowed to vote, even women! No more corrupt governments or landlords. No more rack rent to pay. They will share among themselves, so nobody goes hungry. They can pool their resources and buy new farm equipment which they will all share fairly. The movement is secular—no more tithing. It supports education for everyone, allowing people to get better jobs and have a choice of profession. It doesn't support wars among the plutocrats, which are all fought with your blood for their gain. The movement is international, and has a bright red flag and stirring songs. Naturally, it is being fought tooth and nail by the government, the church, and the landlords, so it may require a violent revolution to bring it about, but it would be worth it.
Of course, it never worked out that way in practice. But for someone whose life was one of inescapable, impoverished misery as a despised member of an inferior class, I can easily see the appeal.
A lot of Americans don't get this because the United States never had a nobility and a peasantry (except for the slaves, who were another story). America also went to universal male suffrage pretty early on, and they lived in a continent so incredibly wealthy that it wasn't too difficult to make money.
Communism actually adopted many ideas from the United States, such as social equality and republican government.","","",""
"How would you suggest to tax the rich without it hitting the middle/low class?","https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-suggest-to-tax-the-rich-without-it-hitting-the-middle-low-class","3.6K views","51 upvotes","4 shares","18 comments","The simple answer: make more rich.
That’s the funny thing in America today…economics has become so complicated, few people comprehend what they suggest.
For example, let’s say your goal is to maximize the amount of tax revenue available for government to redistribute or spend. The best way to do this is to boost GDP…the more economic activity, the more taxes the government gets. One way or another, the Federal government taxes all economic activity, so every 1% boost in GDP is worth about $60–70 billion in new tax revenue to the US Treasury. This should make sense - the bigger the economy, the more government gets.
Now, how do you boost GDP?
Well, one way not to boost GDP is to increase taxes. When you do, the rich that already pay the lion’s share of taxes have less money to spend or invest, and the money they give to the government is less productive than it would be in the hands of the individual. Tax the rich, and GDP goes down…indeed, for every billion dollars you take from the rich, the economy as a whole tends to get about 8,000 fewer jobs.
Plus, when you tax the rich, people have an uncanny ability to rearrange their finances so as to pay less in taxes. You might take shares of stock instead of wages, or trade wages for other company perks. Change the rules of the game, and behavior changes accordingly.
In other words, if you want to raise taxes on the rich, you have to raise them substantially just to break even. Raise taxes, say 3% and people will find ways to avoid the tax increase, so typically you barely break even. The difference is, the higher tax rate results in lower GDP growth, so you’re trading the increased tax revenue from GDP growth for higher tax rates that don’t necessarily get you much of anything. Obama learned this lesson the hard way…the most notable outcome of his tax increases was the worst post-recession GDP growth in postwar history.
So let’s get back to the original question…how do you boost the tax revenues the country gets from rich people? You create more rich people.
Consider for a moment that instead of taxing the rich, you let them keep more of their money. They spend or invest it, creating jobs and prosperity at a faster rate than before. In fact, the greater prosperity results in some of the middle class suddenly becoming the new rich, and as the pool of rich people grows, government gets more and more tax revenue from them.
But don’t believe me - look at the economics around every major tax cut since 1960, and this is the pattern you see. If you really want the government to have more tax revenue, then the most surefire way to achieve this goal is to lower taxes, reduce regulation and shrink government so that it’s voracious appetite for money is less.
Do this seriously, and there will be more rich people than we know what to do with. Yes, it’s counter to the tax-the-rich class warfare many have been taught, but it’s really economics 101…when you tax something, you tend to get less of it - and this applies to wealth and prosperity generally as much as anything else.","","",""

"How much money do your books make?","https://www.quora.com/How-much-money-do-your-books-make","12.7K views","205 upvotes","2 shares","11 comments","Most people prefer to ignore questions like “how much money do you make” or “what’s your salary,” on the grounds that the question is intrusive and nobody’s business but the IRS’s.
But writers’ earnings generally come from royalties and advances against royalties. Royalties consist of a small percentage of the list price of the book (10% or more for hardcover, 4–10% for paperback, 25% or so on ebooks) per copy sold, with exceptions spelled out in the contract.
But in most cases, publishers assume more risk by paying the author an advance that is due on signing the contract, on submitting the finished manuscript, or on publication of one or more editions of the book — or the advance is parceled out among some combination of these occasions.
This advance is non-refundable, provided the author has complied with the terms of the contract. That is, if the book does not sell enough copies to earn out the advance through royalties, the author does not have to refund the difference. If the book does sell more copies and earns out the advance, then and ONLY then does the publisher begin to pay royalties on amounts earned beyond the amount of the advance.
For new writers, advances are usually low — $3,000 was the usual amount when I started back in the 1970s, and I’ve heard of lower and higher numbers today. Advances on early books are usually less than a month’s expenses … though when Edgar Rice Burroughs was paid $3,000 for a serialized book back in the 1920s, that was enough to live well for a year. The numbers didn’t change along with the economy. <sigh>
So when your friend has his first book come out, do not assume that he’s now “rich and famous.” The money is already gone and he’s still living from his day job. And as for “famous,” writer-fame isn’t the same as actor-fame or athlete-fame. Even people who love books, even people who work in bookstores, don’t recognize most authors or their names. (Spoken from constant and continuing experience.) If you want fame, writing is not the way to go.","","",""

“Savings via tax cuts” isn't something you can distribute. It's not there. You never collected the taxes. People just kept what was already theirs. Taxes attempt to redistribute what they have.
Kinda like going to the store for a $10 book. And you have ten $1 bills in your pocket. But, the book is on sale for $8. So, you buy it for $8 and you keep $2.

A lot of the answers here talking about the movement, and craftsmanship bla bla. Honestly that was furthest from my mind when I bought mine. For me there were three clear reasons that compelled me:
The purchase of this watch was based on two successful professional milestones for me. The first was on my second year as a self employed consultant I had just come off the phone from my accountant at my year end and he told me there was a decent amount of money left in the business. So I went and bought my first Rolex a Datejust 2. The second, was I’d just finished a big property refurbishment project and I had refinanced taking out a decent amount of money I had put in. So I traded my Datejust and upgraded to the Yatchmaster pictured. I remember both of those wins whenever I wear the watch, that for me is worth it.
Safe store of money. I’ve worn this watch sparingly for over a year and it is worth £1k more used than I bought it for new, so close to 10% increase. Not bad.
My friends have them. Haha. Shallow reason yes, I admit there’s an element of competitiveness or keeping up with the Jones’s. I also like my appearance to be a positive reflection of where I am in life. And finally, I could afford it so why the f not?! Haha.

First, more generations generally equals more people. Let’s assume a couple with three kids strikes it rich. If those three children produce six or seven grandkids, by the time the money makes its way down to that third generation, it has to be divided up more times.
Second, there are going to be life events, such as business failures or divorces, that impact the fortune over time. Issues like substance abuse and gambling problems - which can visit any family - can also make fortunes evaporate quickly.
Third, it’s not a given that traits like intelligence will be passed down from generation to generation. The person who makes the initial fortune may have been a literal genius, but the grandkids may be closer to average in the brains department.
Finally, comfort often saps people’s drive and/or makes them less appreciative of the money they have. When you know, for example, that you don’t have to work and can still be comfortable, most people aren’t going to live at the office. Similarly, when you did nothing to earn an enormous amount of money, it’s often easier to spend it, as well. If I had a dollar for every rich kid I know who’s said something along the lines of “it’s just money,” I could probably go buy myself lunch, but that’s a mindset that’s common in people who have money as opposed to those who make money.","","",""

Yes, I think that is fair. The broadest shoulders should carry the heaviest loads.
However, one of my pet ‘hobbyhorse’ ideas recently is what the ‘fair’ ratio is for tax burdens. In the UK, the top 20% pay tax at almost exactly 50 times the rate of the bottom 20%. Is that ratio right? Or should it be higher or lower? Because if we can reach broad consensus on what the correct ratio is, then we can keep our taxation levels ‘fair’ in lockstep.
The difficulty with the current state of affairs is that there is an assumption that every change to the tax code should increase taxes on higher earners and reduce taxes on lower earners. If it doesn’t then it is attacked as ‘regressive’. That may be correct with the way our tax is current structured - but presumably we cannot continue to change the tax burden on that basis indefinitely. There must be some point at which we have reached the optimum desirable ratio of sharing the tax burden between higher earners, lower earners and those who sit at various points in between.
But nobody ever seems interesting in trying to discuss what exactly that ratio should be.

That is, wealthy people are much more likely to use their money to save their time, not just because they have the money to do it, but because they have an internal value that they put on their own time that less wealthy people don’t have.
I grew up in a lower-middle class family, surrounded by other lower-middle class families. The adults in my life back then took pride in being able to do things on their own, even if the savings were trivial.
“That cake is $5? I could buy the ingredients and make it myself for $3. What a ripoff!”
As a kid, since that was all I’d ever been exposed to, that kind of thinking made sense to me. I remember several times helping my parents make or build or do things that they could have paid someone else to make or build or do, but they knew how to do it, had the right tools, and… most importantly… didn’t put a price tag on their free time. So they just did it themselves.
And, maybe, they enjoyed doing some of those things, too. Maybe the person who spends an hour making a cake to save $2 on it actually enjoys baking? Or maybe they didn’t realize that they’ve valued themselves at just $2 an hour?
In college, I took a job working for a very wealthy suburban Chicago family, taking care of their disabled son. My eyes were opened to the world of things you could pay people to do for you, for no other reason than you valued your free time. I think the most eye-opening incident of all was when they catered their Thanksgiving dinner. At my house as a child, prepping Thanksgiving dinner was a multi-day, several hundred dollar event. It required multiple trips to different grocery stores, a day of cleaning the house and prepping the food, cooking the food all morning, spending a few hours enjoying it, then a day’s worth of clean-up the next day. It was exhausting.
But my bosses that first Thanksgiving I worked for them? It took them like 30 minutes to pick the food they wanted from a catering menu and order it. Their entire Thanksgiving break was all about spending time with friends and family, with absolutely no stress from dealing with the meal part of the holiday.
And, all told, they probably didn’t spend that much more than my parents spent on all of the groceries and whatnot, so they could do it all themselves.
I live an upper-middle class lifestyle myself these days, and the value of my own time is always on my mind when making decisions.
This evening, for example, I have no dinner plans. I could stop at the grocery store on my way home, get everything I need to make, say, burritos, go home, make them, then clean up the kitchen afterwards… OR, I could just open a new window on my laptop really quickly, log on to Grub Hub, spend about three minutes ordering the usual from the local Mexican restaurant, and have it delivered to me at home. It would cost about $20 more, but would save me an hour of work. Am I worth $20 an hour to myself? I think so.","","",""

Complete secrecy is harder because most wealth of that type winds up getting involved in public companies like Home Depot. Those companies have to disclose things like how much they pay their executives. This is why we know exactly how much Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook make every year. Their companies have to disclose this information because they’re public companies. The ownership stakes of these companies is also public so we know how many shares of Meta Zuck owns.

Neither will happen. What they would do is specialise in hiding wealth. That is what entrepreneurs across the developing world do. The guy who is smart enough to run a great corporation will also be smart enough to buy politicians and tax authorities. There will be rampant corruption. Do you want their intelligence to go in corrupting the society? Or in productively working with the society?
We are born unequal and thus will have inequalities in wealth. Some will be smart with great careers while others might not be.
Here is a simpler way to reduce income inequality:
Fight the crony capitalism — where the governments favor particular companies. Instead make it easy for the small entrepreneurs to succeed and thrive. These small companies would compete with the large companies, driving down price & profits - helping consumers save more as well as reducing inequalities. EU is the only place where they do a somewhat decent job at protecting competition and thereby having lower inequalities.
If you have to vote for reducing inequality, vote for more productive competition. In sectors with monopolies (on say Operating system for mobile phones or laptops), governments should be mandated to fund research on alternatives and provide the R&D free to the domestic companies. US government’s work on Internet and GPS, and India’s UPI payment system created 1000s of companies in a competitive economy. That is the perfect example of government at work.

Plenty of passionate educators have opened these institutions to meet needs they felt were going unacknowledged. For example, Ron Clark founded the Ron Clark Academy to give students a learning environment that promoted more creativity, innovation, and a stronger passion for learning than other options could. When Clark, the 2000 Disney Teacher of the Year, opened the doors of the academy, every student and teacher entered the building via a 20-foot indoor slide, proving it would be an institution that dared to be different.
Then there’s Mercedes Ricon, founder of Killian Oaks Academy, in Miami, Florida. Ricon wanted to promote a more individualized learning experience. The school she founded accomplishes this by allowing no more than 10 children per class and by seating them in a semicircle around the teacher.
Perhaps your reasons for wanting to start a private school are similar to Ricon’s or Clark’s. Or maybe you want to integrate elements that are excluded from a public school’s curriculum — such as religion — into the education of the children in your community. No matter what drives you to learn how to start a private school, this guide will help you achieve your goal.
Who can open a private school?
Many people who have opened private schools have been educators. But that background is not required. There is also a difference between completing educational requirements to become a principal of a private school and owning a private school.
You can start and own a private school if you obtain and file the proper nonprofit or for-profit articles of incorporation with your state. Doing so is a simple business transaction.
How to start a school: The steps to take
Planning
Start small, and begin by taking inventory of the needs of your community. Research the already-existing school options in your area to determine whether another private school would be appropriate or well-received. In particular, you’ll want to learn whether any school already in operation is filling the need that you believe exists.
Once you establish a need, work on how you envision meeting that need. Will all subjects have equal priority? Or will you instead focus on liberal arts or STEM or other foundations for careers? Or will you want most subjects to take a back seat to a religious perspective?
Will your school accept students from grades K through 12? Or do you plan, instead, to provide a curriculum only for elementary-, middle-, or high-school pupils? And where will your school be located?
This is not an exhaustive list of considerations. But it does provide a good starting point from which you can clarify your intentions.
Once your intentions are clear, share them with like-minded people who have business, legal, or educational experience. Put a committee together that will be ultimately responsible for pushing the school through its early stages. You can grow this core group as the school establishment process goes on.
Making a basic business plan
Remember, as you seek to provide students with a quality education, that a private school is, nonetheless, a business. It calls for a good business plan.
These four elements are crucial to your business plan when you are starting a private school.
Four must-have sections of a business plan will let you dive deep into the logistical side of starting a school. Section 4, the financial plan, will include
whether the school will be nonprofit or for-profit
how much funding it will need to operate effectively
how the money will be obtained
Be sure to have a solid business plan in place before seeking funding. Donors will feel more comfortable contributing if they know how you are using their money.
Funding and hiring go hand in hand since part of the budget you will create will go toward paying your faculty and staff for their time and expertise. Be sure you know how much you can afford to pay before you begin bringing people on board.
Hiring personnel
Don’t forget to establish clear criteria for screening potential employees. Regardless of your school’s mission, you’ll want to be certain those on your payroll are in alignment with them. This benefits the students who will walk your hallways and you and the staff members you hire.
Survey your committee members to try to find human-resources expertise. Also, consider reaching out to administrators of other schools for advice on what criteria to establish. While you build a network of private school experts, it helps to join a national or regional private school association, such as the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). Take advantage of the connections and networking opportunities that membership creates.
Scout out potential faculty and staff members who not only align with your school’s mission but also have the proper degrees, licensure, and certifications, as required by your state. Post ads on education-specific job boards and attend teacher job fairs. Once you’ve begun hiring, don’t forget to implement training or orientation sessions to familiarize employees with the school’s values, policies, and expectations.
Registering the school
Last, you’ll need to register your school with the state. Each U.S. state has different regulations and accreditations that a school must meet. You’ll need to do thorough research on what the applicable state deems necessary for your school to open its doors. Start by consulting the U.S. Department of Education’s private and home school state regulation map.
It never hurts to enlist the aid of a reliable legal professional to help you navigate this step of the process. You’ll want to be sure all of your bases are covered, so you don’t violate any education laws.
How to find prospective students
Finally, address the most important part of any school: the students. Making yourself familiar with the ins and outs of private school marketing is one of the best ways to attract your desired demographic.
While word of mouth and community engagement go a long way in establishing any new business, don’t underestimate the value of a strong social media presence and user-friendly website. Be sure your brand is clear, and let prospective students and their parents know what makes your school stand out from the rest.
Start planning your private school
