"As of August 2023 all of my major derogs (an unpaid collection, an unpaid charge off, and some 120 day late payments) will be off my report, but I will still have a handful of 30 day lates that will all be 2+ years old. I'll also be 3/24 and 0/12 with between 1-3 hard inquiries on each report. My FICO 8 scores as of this month (from a free trial at Experian) are EX 639 TU 660 EQ 698. Chex pulled yesterday shows one inquiry from 12/2021 when I opened my Apple Card, but I just joined Affinity FCU earlier this week so that should hit soon. Finances (other than 401k, RIP) are in robust shape with current DTI ~12% and income ~$150k.  I already plan on becoming a member at NFCU but I'm waiting until I have my grandfathers DD 214 in hand before doing so. Aside from the aforementioned CU's  I’m open to joining up to 3 more over the next year to see where they eventually take me. My interest would be in organizations that offer credit cards with robust cash back rewards who are willing to offer decent starting CLs to individuals with an imperfect credit history. Organizations that require no hard pull to join and offer reliable credit card preapproval tools and free checking and/or savings accounts with higher interest rates and without minimum transaction/direct deposit requirements would be highly desirable but not required. For membership requirements, I live in California and work in healthcare (though I'm not a licensed person i.e. an RN). I've read through these forums quite a bit and I'm overwhelmed with the vast number of credit unions that virtually anyone can join. Does anyone have any that they recommend given my history/goals? If multiple recommendations, in what order should I join, given that some are more sensitive to Chex than others?","My advice would be:1. First look for more specialized credit unions that are limited to your geography, your employer or affiliations, or your industry. Those often have the best deals.2. Then look to see which have the types of credit offerings you are looking for.3. Then email the ones you're interested in to see if they have a HP for membership. I'm not saying you should exclude them on that basis, but you should know ahead of time. 4. Then wait at least 3 months between applications. Some credit unions are sensitive to Chex Systems inquiries, which are pulled by most institutions when you apply for a deposit account. As a general rule, credit unions rarely have the greatest cash rewards cards, and -- except for the larger, more nationwide, credit unions -- don't often start you off with large credit limits."
"What's a good strategy for picking a bank for a high yield savings account? This is emergency money only, and I'm trying not to overthink things. I'm considering Alliant Credit Union, Barclays, and (possibly) Synchrony. I've had my eye on Alliant for a couple months, but I know less about the other two options. Should I just pick one at random? I'm wary of Synchrony because it doesn't seem like a traditional financial institution to me (and if I'm going to have money there, I don't want to worry). Should I flip a coin between the other two options?","Depending how liquid you need it to be, you could also consider CDs.   US Alliance currently has a special 2 year CD paying 3%, which is the highest I have seen.   Now I wouldn't lock in for two years as rates will almost certainly increase very soon, but 1 year CDs paying 2+% might be worth considering."
"Hello and greetings everyone!  I'm so glad to be here, and I want to thank you all for your time and advice! I'm 52, I have a FICO score of 820, I am completely debt free except for a very low mortgage payment, and have $80,000 total in my retirement accounts, split evenly between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. I know what you're all shouting at the screen - ""Wait, you're 50 with only $80,000!!!  You should be 30 with that amount""!Just wait, it's not quite as bad as you might think.  I've finally reached the point in my life where I finally own everything that I need (including some extras like a motorcycle, HD dually pickup truck and a camper to enjoy life a bit), and can cover all of my monthly expenses without earning another single penny of income from work.  That's it though, so I have absolutely no ""spending"" or ""fun"" money (and we all know that's no way to live!). I'm fairly confident especially now having my days completely free, that I can ""play"" various investment markets and safely earn around 4% monthly or perhaps even weekly (simply meaning that my $80,000 would become $83,200 within that short time).  So that brings me to my question, which is this: Aside from any advice regarding not ""playing"" with or substantially risking my entire life savings, and also assuming that my earning projections above are accurate, and that I'd like to begin withdrawing the earnings only portion on a weekly or monthly basis after one year and a day (assuming that is the soonest that I can withdraw the gains without paying any short-term gains tax up to the $80,000 limit); my question is should I take the entire $80,000 completely out of the IRA's and go ahead and pay the 10% early withdraw penalty and the regular income tax on at least $40,000 (perhaps more depending on the tax laws regarding early withdraw of Roth IRA money), and place the remaining $62,400 - $67,200 into a no fee self-directed brokerage account (such as Robinhood, etc.)? If not, then please give me detailed reasons why not, or perhaps what and why would be even smarter, keeping in mind of course that 1) I'm NOT going to work another day of my life for income, and 2) I must begin withdrawing at least some money as soon as possible (let's say within a year at the latest).","Right, that was my first thought when the OP said all expenses are covered.  As a retiree, I wanted to ask about medical.  Pre-medicare (and even after) what are you doing to cover those.  Basically, your capital can be wiped out very easily by a fairly minor medical incident if not well insured. I also feel the 4% weekly/monthly is wildly optimistic!   If it were that easy, lots of people would be slowly (or not so slowly) trading up their spare $1000 or so.     Yes, sticking to big companies means you are unlikely to lose all your capital, but.    you buy stock X at $100, expecting it to flutuate to say $103 (and be sure you can sell at that price).  Instead it goes to $97 and stays there for weeks.    Yes, with a bit of luck it goes above $100 again at some point, but during this time you are not getting your income."
"Hey everyone - For those of you that have a Sofi Checking/Savings how are you liking them? I was considering making them my primary bank over Chase and getting the 2% Card from SoFi. I'd love to hear the good, bad and ugly. Thank you!","I'm using them, they seem fine, but they're far from my primary bank, and I would never want to put too many eggs into the basket of a purely internet institution like that."
"My CU has offered a special interest (dividend) earning checking account for the past few years.  Previously, it earned 2% APY, now it just went up to 3%.  But, of course, there's conditions, which is why I haven't jumped as of yet.  But at 3%, it's getting tempting. It earns up to 3% APY on balances up to $10,000.  But, in order to earn this rate, I would have to: 1.  Direct deposit at least $1k/month.  No problem there.2.  Log into online banking at least once per month.  No problem there.3.  Make at least $500 per month in point-of-sale or online purchases using my debit card. It's no. 3 that gives me hesitation.  Security concerns mainly.  Keeping $10K in a checking account (to maximize earnings) and then having to use the debit card in a bunch of places to earn the higher APY, sounds like a great way to get cleaned out if the debit card info gets hacked/stolen/compromised. I use credit cards almost exclusively for all non-cash purchases, since if those get compromised, I'm only out that card/credit line and not my checking account I pay all my bills out of.  Also, I earn cash back on my cards, which I'd lose some if I had to shift a bunch of spend to the debit card.  I'd have to weigh if $300/year (probably closer to $200 after taxes) is worth losing a chunk of CC rewards and security over. Also, my spend isn't always super consistent and there is no one thing (even groceries) that consistently exceeds $500/month.  If I had one thing I spent that much on every month, it would be easy.  And if I miss the target, the account only earns 0.05% that month. If online bill pay counted toward the $500 debit card spend, it would be a no brainer.  But no, it has to be purchases/swipes on the debit card.  I don't even know if a recurring subscription/payment would count. I miss the old days when you could just put money in a savings account and earn interest on it without having to jump through hoops.","I agree with you 100%. Which is why I consider that type of account worthless. Using a debit card for purchases is really dangerous, unless the accounts to which the card is linked have an insignificant balance, in which case the 3% interest is meaningless. You could get 3.5% interest in a completely safe savings account at Affinity FCU (up to $5k)."
"Hello all, looking for some advice. i am assisting my wife build her credit, she became a perm resident in august of last year. since getting her social and green card we have gotten her the following accounts 10/2021 cap 1 plat $500 limit12/2021Walmart Card $300 limit01/2021 GS Apple Card $1000 limit I know an installment would make profile much stronger. id like to get her credit geared up so she can finance a car in the next year or year and a half.  my question is would a secured loan for say around 2k be worth it? if so, how many months should she get it for? id hate to have it for more than 6 months since I'm paying interest on our own money. should we go longer term and higher amount? we plan on going with Navy Fed since we bank there. any tips will help! thank you",Simple.  Put $3100 into her savings account. Take out a $3100 share secured loan for 60 months. Then with the loan proceeds immediately pay down the loan to $280.  Then make tiny payments for the next 57 months or so. Once the $280 balance reports she'll get a nice score boost in FICO 8's and 9's. I'm assuming she is not on any other installment loans.
"Hi folks, When we bought our home there was some unfinished work the seller was supposed to handle to get permits from the town. Long story short, he's ignored the contract, I'm paying out of pocket and then having to sue. This has been an arduous process and after 4 years and $18,000 in my own cash, it's time for work to actually begin.. and I need a loan for another $18k. I have offers from Amex, Discover.. I'm a NFCU member... Mortgage with WF.. I'm not really sure who or what to go with and look for, I've never taken a loan before? I know one thing, I absolutely can't afford any of them but I'll have to figure it out like everything else. Amex and NFCU offer me 7.4x%.. is that the best I can do? HELOCs seem to all have closing costs and want me to borrow $35k.  Any advice? Contractor starts working tomorrow. Should be less than a week worth of work.","I think you should take out one of the 7.4% personal loans, preferably NFCU. Not good to borrow against your home. I agree with @CreditCuriosity that Lightstream is good, too -- a no-hassle, fast-moving application process. But I would go with the lowest rate."
"Hey everyone. POINT ONE:Recently opened a brand new account with Clackamas Federal Credit Union for a 2.275% APY on their Plus Checking account. Seems like a pretty great deal, cap is at $15k (I am aware others are better but they're local to me) and I thought this would be a good start for trying out high-yield checking. So... at the branch the guy told me specifically only in-person POS transactions are going to be the only way to generate credit towards the APY. I need twelve transactions a month. Capped out, what would be the best strategy? At $15,000, that's $341.25 yield per year. Twelve $1 purchases each month would wind up being $144 opportunity dollars being spent to net gain of of $197.25. :thinking: Does that put the actual value of my savings to 1.37%? Am I crazy or is that not .. awesome? Or wait, is it 341.25 ÷ 144 = 2.37%? ... ? POINT TWO: I wish it wasn't this difficult. Selling my house and going to be sitting on a chunk of cash to buy my next house with burning a hole in my wallet while I work on some stuff. Want to diversify/save my nest egg in the best way possible to grow it while I wait about a year to purchase my next home. I am interested in as many considerations as possible. This is a new realm for me. Thanks all!","Many dollars have been lost striving for a little more yield. To use a debit card which is attached to an account with a significant amount of money in it is risky.  If there is fraud due to exposure at a card reader, your savings could be wiped out or frozen. As to your arithmetic, no it makes no sense. The yield is 2.275%.  But it's better to have your savings in a place where it's safe."
"Has this ever happened to anyone here? Got a notification from MyFico that one of my oldest accounts had closed. Speficially a $2500 overdraft credit line I started in 2013. I opened my Woodforest bank Account in 2011 around the time of my divorce and had maintained an account with them becuase of the Re-Li loan I had with them of $2500 ot help rebuild my credit. This is their main credit product for retail consumers and isnt a credit card. It makes it possible to move money from the Re-Li line to your personal checking when needed. It also serves as an OverDraft account.  It was such a longstanding account I didnt want to close anything with such a long and perfect payment history. Even after I stopped actively banking with them in 2018 and moved to Chase as my primary, I kept an account with cash in it active in order to maintain the account. I would occiasionally move some money out of the credit line to keep it active. Every couple of years I would get a form asking me to sign to continue the account. I always did so and everything worked out well. However, his time arround they didn't renew it and now its closed. I have since gone into a branch and closed the account wholesale. It sucks to lose an old account, but the CL was only $2.5K, and my recent $8K CLI from NFCU more than compensates.

Personal lines of credit, unlike credit cards, shouldn't require a lot of activity. They should just remain available for a rainy day. And certainly, if the institution does insist on some activity, they ought to have given you a heads up."
"Hi I've never applied or gotten a personal loan before. I checked Penfed ""check your rate"" and it didn't give me anything. No offers. Well I checked again today, for $10k and it showed me 3 offers all with the same 17.99% rate but different loan terms. 36m, 12m and 60m. I'll upload a pic of what it looks like. It caught my attention that it said, ""Your approved request loan amount:"" I got excited because im trying to get a personal loan but rates with online lenders are 27% and above. Some at 38% and one even at 84%! So seeing 17.99% warmed my heart. But not im just thinking it was a generic offers screen and I dont stand a chance. 😩 my scores are EQ653 EX653 TU648. Util61% one redeemed repo 5yrs old. One late payment one year old. 38k credit card debt. 3 paid car loans.

I am eyeing several tempting bank offers such as $200-$375 bonuses for opening a checking account plus direct depositing once. So any downside to doing these offers? I guess I could possibly get flagged for fraud for making too many DD requests in the next few months. Or should I just do it once a year to avoid any possible problems?,"Right, and remember, like chasing credit card SUBs, this is basically a ""hobby"" rather than (unlike say ""professional"" MS) a way to make a lot of money.   So @difringe getting say $500 6 times a year pre-tax is certainly nice, but probably doesn't cause a significant life style change! The only things to look out for, perhaps more likely in retirement, is the various tax cliffs that occur, where earning an extra $1 can prove very expensive."
"I have BOA checking and credit cards. Is there anyway to use an external checking account e.g. Chase to pay for my BOA credit cards? In the BOA webiste, it seems that I can only choose BOA checking account to pay for BOA CC. It possibly can be done at Chase website to pay for an external CC but I prefer to do it using BOA website.","Sounds like a piece of cake.   I have a BoA checking account w/direct deposit and CCs. I usually pay my BoA CCs from their checking account, but every few months I use Bill Pay from a credit union to pay them. I have savings & checking at DCU and Service CU primarily for their savings account interest rate, but figure using their Bill Pay every so often makes it look like I'm not there just for their high interest savings. And BoA charges a $3 fee to push an ACH to an external account, so I don't link external accounts to BoA, I pull from BoA."
"Hello all, I haven't posted in a while, but I have worked so hard to get my credit score to where it is (all 700s). I have maintained this for about four years; however, I moved to Miami last year, which is way more expensive than I could've fathomed. My pay on my job (teacher) has significantly been reduced, as I am no longer teaching an extra class that I taught before because the population at the school has decreased. I added an $810.00 car payment that was okay last year, but now I'm drowning. Also, I found a note on my apartment door informing me that my rent is going up $300 in 90 days, which is my renewal date. All apartments around here seem to be in the same cost range. My credit card debt is very high right now, all with Navy Federal ($47,000). My check no longer covers my bill's. Does anyone have any tips on what I could do to salvage my credit without losing everything? Any help is appreciated; I'm kind of terrified right now. Please don't scold; I just desperately need some advice.","You're getting some good advice and encouragement, @jazzyvar84. So sorry to hear of your situation but you can work your way through this, one piece of it at a time. Hang in there. The truck situation is tricky. @USMC_Winger had a good suggestion to put it to work for you, if that is a possibility.  If not, I agree that $810 car payment needs to go away. Yes you may be able to sell the truck. Depending on how much money you put down, the price you paid, and the current value of the truck, you may be ""upside down"" after only one year where you owe more than it's worth today. Do some research on the web and take it to several car dealerships. You can get offers to buy it from Car Max or Carvana among others. Compare the offers to what you owe and see if it is feasible. If you can't pay off the loan with either the sales price or combined with cash on hand, your current lender won't release the lien on your title to transfer ownership.  Depending on the terms of your loan, you could try to refinance with a different lender to lower your payments. This could be done by lowering the APR (although that would be challenging in this rate environment) or extending the repayments by another year or two.  If you cannot sell the truck, voluntary surrender back to the lender (in lieu of repossession) is possible but it can also adversely affect your credit. However, it would look better than having a repossession and would relieve you of the burden of the monthly payments.  The lender would sell the truck and you would be responsible for the difference in value unless the lender agreed to forgive the shortage.   If you're unable to pay, they could file for collections of the difference.  But if you work with them, they might allow you to set up a payment plan.   The surrender and/or collections will be indicated on your credit report and could affect your scores for up to seven years. So this is a consideration but would be a last resort other than not paying until the lender repossesses the truck. Repossession would likely entail other charges for the repo and storage costs. The first step is to get the value versus the payoff amount of the loan.  If you have more value than you owe, I would sell it and find a more economical ride."
"Hi, everyone. You all helped me in the past so i thought i coukd get some help again  im happy to report i got a promotion, large raise, and house in 2020! Im lucky that my situation was made better in the pandemic, and ive really been trying my best to appreciate that because i know thats not the case for many.I had two major expenses in 2021--my dog had emergency surgery ($7500) and i had to replace my roof ($7900), otherwise, i would be further along in my debt repay,ent than i am. My grandma passed away last month and im awaiting a life insurance policy of about. $47000... The check should arrive by the end of the week.  She pinched pennies her whole life so i want to honor her by using this wisely, as i know that she wants me to be financially secure (no shopping sprees or trips to dubai yet).Im now 33 years old, a homeowner, single, animal parent, and i make $70k annually at my primary job and another $750 or so on the side hustle. so heres where im at.

That will leave an additional $7k or so cash, lending club loan at $6964.34 and bank of america at $10,548.60, a total of $$17,512.94 on my lowest interest accounts. i will have an extra. $1500/m and i thought i would pay $500 to debt and $1000 to savings. Im worried with the inflation and want to really start building my savings up and open a roth, which i havent been able to do up until this point. I also already have the house, so i have no large purchases planned for years (maybe a new car in a few...i have two cars owned outright that both run well, and im not really a car person anyways). with all that said, im open to suggestions. Maybe i should just bite the bullet and pay the entiretly to debt and all $1500m until its gone? Pay other cards that make more sense? Pay loans vs credir cards? Im not sure theres a benefit to pating off either, or a disadvantage to paying everything at once. thank you, all, in advance!! ps sorry for the errors--im on mobile.","It's a no brainer that you should pay off all the credit cards, then pay off the smaller lending club balance, then apply the rest to the remaining loan, and then when your scores have improved significantly, refinance the remaining loan with a credit union at a much lower rate."
"Does anyone have recommendations on where I can put some savings that I dont have easy access to?

"I know no one knows their exact formula for their internal scoring system. I get the basics about direct deposit(s) which I now have about $10000 a month of direct deposits going in.

I'll also likely transfer in stock I can purchase via my employer's discounted program once every few months as well.  The digital investor product seems a bit ""removed"" from the regular app so I'm less sure if the internal score would ""see"" that but I also see no real harm adding just $100 a month to it and allowing NFCU to hold stocks I've purchased elsewhere at a discount given the small fee a month if it might possibly increase my internal score.",Time and relationship matter the most.My internal score was 333 and I was denied for flagship.I now have a $35k flagship and my score has been lower than 333 the entire time since I got it till now.Just keep making smart descisions and it will work out.GL!
Can I get a home loan and car loan if I have bad credit?,Maybe yes but the terms of the loan will be bad. And the fact that you can get the loan doesn't mean you can really afford it.  They're glad to give out home loans and auto loans like candy to people who can't really afford them.  And then they foreclose on your home and repossess your vehicle. Sub-prime borrowing is a trap for poor people.
If anyone has knowledge of which CU's do soft credit inquiries instead of hard can you please let me know?  I am considering moving accounts to CU's and would like to find 4-5 CU's that I could start relationships with.  But i prefer not to have hard inquiries to start.  THANK YOU for any info you can provide.,"IMHO the best way to go about this is to find some credit unions you like, and then email them asking ""Is there a hard credit pull for membership applications?""

"Just joined Navy Federal today. I only opened the free savings & checkings account and was assured multiple times it would be a soft pull only.

Or maybe just wait another year and hope things don't get even worse. Question is, should I stay my current course of no hard pulls, no new lines of credit, etc. until mortgage time? Or should I get one of their offerings? looking through the forums, I see folks with quite a lot of cards. What is normal/recommended to have? If it's important to any of this, yearly income is about 95k.","1. If you don't need more cards, stay the course.  3 cards is enough to build your scores steadily.  When you get close to a mortgage application, go to AZEO -- letting one card report a small balance while the other 2 report zeroes. 2. If you do trip across some credit product you really want to have, be sure to apply for it only if your mortgage application is 13 or more months away. 3. I disagree with your characterization of paying rent as throwing your money away. You're paying to have a roof over your head. Home ownership, even when home prices are great -- which they are not presently -- can be a huge money trap. 4. Mortgages can be a huge money trap as well.  Lenders give out mortgages to people who can't really afford home ownership.  Since it's a secured loan, they don't care. They'll just take your home away from you if you don't pay.  They may not even continue to hold the loan, but sell it off in a bundle as part of a security. I've noticed that the credit unions I belong to, who are all very cautious about granting me unsecured credit, are all more than eager to push me into auto loans and home mortgages. Why? Because their risk is virtually nonexistent. If I don't pay, they would just repossess my car, and/or foreclose on my home.  Be glad you're not heavily in debt; once you become a homeowner that may well change."

If you have no other open installment loans, you might take a slight hit, but I would not expect a big hit."
"Last night i re-viewed a few videos earlier this year talking about the Amex Rewards Checking account. After looking at the 0.60% interest earning and 1 MR point per $2, i went ahead and got approved for it, should be getting the Debit card by next week and already transfered some funds over. No minimum is required and no monthly fees, or direct deposit needed. I just linked my Chase account. Picture this, their's a few things that i cant use my CC's for so i use Debit here and there for example my rent. I have to purchase a money order to pay my rent, since i shouldn't do that with a CC, i can use this DEBIT card to pay for the money order and earn MR points for it. Same thing for my utilities, and paying off other cards. I dont have any other MR reward cards yet.","Check the terms.   While it is certainly easier to buy a money order with a (non-gift) debit card than with a credit card, it looks like the MR program says it will not give rewards on purchases of cash or cash equivalents.   So if they know it is a money order, they MAY not give the rewards."
"I have 20k in my chase savings account since I have my mortgage, checking, freedom unlimited, and amazon accounts with them. The APY of .02% on my savings is terrible but I want to keep using chase for checking due to how convenient chase is for me. However, I want to open a high yield savings account and move most my savings in there to get a good APY. I've narrowed myself down to Discover and Citi. Discover would have a $150 SUB for me but if I do Citi and end up getting any Citi cards it might be more convenient to go with them? Then again I know Discover has legendary customer service. For people who have dealt with both lenders, which is the better pick?","My answer would be neither of the above. I agree with @CreditCuriosity I would go with credit unions, like PenFed and Alliant."
the only thing penfed has preapproved me for since becoming a member 2 months ago is an Overdraft line of credit - is this a good way to build a relationship wih them for the future ? or is this kind of a pointless thing to waste a HP for?,"I don't think you should apply for any credit product you wouldn't value having, just to ""build a relationship"".  You would get the hard pull and the new account effects just the same as you would get for a product you really wanted to have."
"Hi all. Barksdale Federal Credit Union is ""taking over"" my local bank and soon I will be eligible for their products and services. I wanted to find out if anyone has credit experience with this credit union? Do they have soft pull increases on credit cards? Do they require POI? And just any other basic info like how easy they are to get approved with and do they send out pre approved offers... Any info would be helpful since I couldn't find anything on the myfico boards. Thank you in advance to anyone that can post info about this credit union.",This Shreveport personsays they've heard that Barksdale is a great credit union.
"I've been gardening for a while and now thinking its time to start tapping into some new cards... specifically Credit Unions. In my research I noticed a particular point in which CUs/Banks use ChexSystems or LexisNexis for new accts. Apparently opening too many accts in ChexSystems is a huge red flag. My question is how many accounts can you open before it becomes an issue? 3? 5? 9!?My strategy was based around a few inquiries based on each bureau but new cards require new accounts. Regardless of TU, EX, & EQ I'm seeing that Chex/LexNex will be tapped per new account. Does anyone have any insight on what is too much?I know the community likes to go on App Sprees opening multiple accounts but has this negatively affected anyone? Feedback Much Appreciated🙏","1. It's a ""huge red flag"" for some institutions, mainly credit unions. For others it's nothing. 2. As near as I can gather from the posts in this forum and from my own experience as a too-many-Chex-inquiries reject, the question isn't how many inquiries is too many, but really how recent the inquiries are. It seems to me that if you go more than 3 months without a Chex inquiry, you're good to go, even with the 'sissy' institutions. 3.  I'm not sure I understand your reference to 'cards'; Chex Systems is totally focused on deposit accounts, not credit accounts. It's got to do with how many new checking/savings accounts you've tried to open with different institutions. It's relevant to those of us who like to cultivate multiple credit union relationships."
"I need advice on this situation Back in May, 2022 I applied for a personal loan with PenFed and I got rejected because of the following:1. Debt deliquency (Already paid off). 2. Legnth of the accounts established 3. Too many inquiries past 12 months (Due to opening a few credit card accounts). In the month of August, 2022 I was approved for an auto loan with PenFed and I am planning to finish repaying the whole amount this November, 2022. My question is......after I finish paying for the  car loan, will this improve my chances to being approved for a personal loan (if I applied)? Thanks in advance","@svali42  When it comes to Credit Unions they consider everything you have with them before lending you more money! The underwriter would calculate credit card limit, auto loan, mortgage and etc. and then determine if you can borrow more secure/unsecured amount!

"I have one 401k account from my previous employer at Fidelity. I want to rollover it to either 401k or IRA to Merril Edge. Are there any fees or penalties involved? What is the best way to do it? I think, IRA is a better option, since I can also slightly contribute to it since my contribution to 401k (current employer) is already capped.","Rolling out your 401k funds from a former employer to an IRA should have zero fees. Some 401k allow you to roll a previous employer 401k into them, also should have no fees if the destination ( your current employer ) 401k can handle it.  Penalties would only result if you take possession of the funds without getting them into a new 401k or IRA destination."
"I was opening several checking accounts recently and now need to close several. It took my attention that some banks provide faster external transfer (ACH) e.g. the next day delivery but some banks were doing it after 4 business days. My parameters for a good checking account in priority: FDIC insured, monthly fee can be waived easily, fast free external ACH transfers, receive DD from employer 2 days early, sufficient check with limited or no fee, no fee for ATM. Which checking account(s) do you suggest to keep (pls add to the list)? Is it better to use brokerage as checking? BOA (~3-5$ fee for external transfers, DD>250$/m to avoid monthly fee, may be needed to keep BOA tier).US Bank (no monthly fee if having CC, external ACH~4 days).Chase (DD>500$ to avoid monthly fee).Citi (any DD to avoid monthly fee).Discover (free, 1% cashbak if using debit).SoFi (using plaid that might be concern for transfers, good APY for checking, does it provide check?).KPCU (no fee, external ACH~1 day).WF (DD>500$ to avoid monthly fee, provides monthly Fico9 score/report).","Of those on your list SoFi checks off all your boxes I believe.Other accounts which fit the bill are Langley FCU, Digital FCU, Affinity FCU (only the 2% cash back checking has the 2 day early direct deposit), and Chartway FCU."

"We recently were denied for a HELOC by our local bank (Florida) and the whole process is a tad confusing.  Hoping that if we share our experience, someone here could recommend a next step for us, as we defintely still want a HELOC option.  We are not in an ideal scenario from a credit health perspective.  We have average to below average credit scores, high DTI ratio, and about $300k in home equity.  The reason we were given for denial was that the risk score did not meet requirements while in underwriting.  TIA for any feedback. Details: Credit scores- for myself and spouse, in the 660 to 699 range.  Income- w2 employment, total $285k base + $70k annually in bonusesMortgage- we refinanced our mortgage in Feb.2022, orignated in 2018.  Currently owe $440k at 3.375%.  Recently appraised at $755k.  Monthly payment $3250.HELOC goal- pay off CC debt.  Total $67k.  Monthly minimum payments equal approx. $1600 per month.   Random facts:We are carrying a high amount of car loan debt, and most if it is new credit lines opened in most recent 12 months.  A total of $3200 in payments monthly, with a loan total of $195k.Personal loans- one at $12k, $385 payment monthly with PenFed.For any fintech that uses AVM, we have a possible problem.  Our homes estimated value on Redfin is $657k and Zillow $365k.  The Zillow guesstimate has always been off, for atleast the last 5 years, due to the county erroneously filing a land lot purchase of $50k under our address a few years ago.  We have tried to get Zillow to correct it based on the appraissals, but no luck.  Not sure if it matters.  Student Loan- one loan at $20k, in interest only payment now as student is in school, payment $90 per month.",My suggestion would be to go to a good credit union and see whether a HELOC or a refi would give you the best deal.
"I am considering a move from USAA for my primary checking account.  I have checking accounts that I barely use at DCU (I opened when taking out a car loan I later refinanced) and Schwab (for international travel), and I have an Alliant membership.  I looked at SoFi but their bill pay makes you set up a payee every time you want to pay a non-constant bill. The Alliant checking account looks attractive but I read somewhere from a few years ago that they don't use the typical Fiserv interface that other institutions use (which includes the ability to receive e-bills).  I was wondering if that has changed. Schwab has unlimited ATM rebates and free checks but pays paltry interest (slightly better than USAA but not much).  DCU pays less interest than Alliant but seems to have e-bills (though I can't get them to work) and allows me to deposit cash at a shared branch without using a local bank account as an intermediary. Anyone have good/bad experiences using any of these as primary checking?","I have familiarity with DCU and Alliant, not with Schwab. And I never use e-bills. Alliant has the advantage of paying interest on the checking account. DCU has the advantages of 2 day early direct deposit in the checking account and the ability to link a credit card to the account as an overdraft line of credit."

"I'm a 26 year old man. In my teenage and young adulthood years I had a very sober mindset about money (I live in a European country) and little interest in personal finance. However, when we face situations that are new, we discover things about ourselves that we did not know. Now I am 26 years old, I work as an engineer in a pharmaceutical company, and this has made me think that maybe I am more ambitious and competitive than I thought. However, despite having a highly qualified job, I live with a flatmate, I have some financial freedom to travel a bit and go out for drinks or a restaurant, but at the end of the month I don't save more than a few hundred euros (if I'm lucky). How am I going to buy a flat without getting into debt for life? This is probably not your typical FICO post, just wanted to share my story and see if I can get some insights. I work every day to improve my technical and social skills, both at work and in the new circles I make. For now, I try to strengthen my job security, and acquire all the resources that can allow me to start trying to climb positions shortly. I don't consider it a waste of time to enjoy what makes you happy one day (going to the forest, for example), but I do feel sometimes that my energy is dispersed, or I don't channel it in the most effective way possible. I would love to know, for example, what qualities/skills do people who are financially successful have? What points to work on? How to make social relations with circles of power?","Rule of thumb for young adults. Open a savings account. Every payday, ten percent of your net income goes into that savings account. It is an emergency fund.  You do not touch it unless you have an emergency. You can also use it to save for a home.  (...or a flat...)  Perhaps save 20% per payday? You are young enough that it is up to YOU.  Set a goal.  Write it down.  Plan the work.  Work the plan. Good luck!"
"Wanted to get some thoughts\opinions on a strategy.  I'm 48 years old, and I am targeting a retirement at age 65.  I won't go into details as to why, but we just bought a house last June at a 2.75% interest rate over 30 years.  I have no car loans. I also have about $15k in credit card debt, along with about $35k in personal loan debt.  The interest rates vary, but looking at the loan\card with the highest rate and making just minimum payments across all tradelines (of course not using the cards or opening more loans), everything could be paid off in 6-7 years. From a compensation standpoint, I am mostly salaried but I do get a quarterly bonus that generally falls in the same range. Along with paying off this debt, my other goal is to have the house paid off by the time I retire.    I built out a debt snowball sheet (with all debts except for my mortgage) as I am able to put an initial $2k towards my loan\CC debt today, and following that sheet, all CC\loans would be paid off in 3 years (The $2k would pay off 5 cards that have a small balance on them as of today). From a compensation standpoint, I am mostly salaried but I do get a quarterly bonus that generally falls in the same range\amount. Question I am grappling with; do I take the money saved by paying off some of these cards and start putting it towards the mortgage each month, and use my quarterly bonuses to pay off debt in chunks, or do I stick to the debt snowball sheet and payoff all personal debt, and then start throwing the extra money saved at the next card (i.e. the traditional debt snowball method)? Thanks!",In my opinion your plan should be to pay off the credit cards first.Then pay off the non-mortage loans.Then pay off the mortgage.
"I saw this credit union in Minnesota called Affinity Plus is offering 1% APY on a money market account, much higher than anyone else. You can join with a $25 donation if you do not qualify any other way. I applied online and submitted copies of my drivers license and Social Security card. A few hours later, I received a message that they could not approve my membership. I went on video chat and the rep was very nice. She said the application system did not know how to handle a fraud alert on either TransUnion or Chexsystems. She sent me a DocuSign paper application to fill out. I sent that back and waited five days. I hadn't heard anything so I inquired again and said that too was denied. She said a letter was coming in the mail and could not give me more details. I know there are no black marks on either TransUnion or ChexSystems other than fraud alerts. I am at somewhat of a loss because I have never been denied a bank account before, let alone any type of credit. I was wondering if anyone had dealt with Affinity Plus and if they are picky with membership applications. What are my changes of getting them to reconsider? I don't know how much more I can do to prove my identity. Clearly this would double my interest income if I can get in with them.","Frankly I would just move on. There are many other fish in the sea. They're probably finicky about out of state members; many credit unions are that way. Some are finicky about your having joined other credit unions. But who wants to be a member of a credit union that doesn't even want you to lend them money?  I once was turned down by a local credit union -- located about a mile from my office, and about a mile and a half from my house -- because my signature on the application wasn't identical to my signature on my drivers license  I figured if they're that stupid, do I really want to enter into a relationship with them?"
"Hello, Perhaps somewhat rashly, I applied for and received a $19,000 debt consolidation loan (20k, with a 1k origination fee). Its 8.99% interest, 3 years, 635.90 payment per month.  Calculation to include the high origination fee, I get about 12.5% interest. Or much lower than my credit cards. But with the short term, I'm feeling like my monthly payment are actually going to go up. My thoughts.A, lets gamble. Discover has been good to me in the past with balance transfers. Pay down discover and hope for a balance transfer to get the other accounts consolidated.  That will leave me with only 2 payments, and the lowest possible interest.  Risk: if no BT, then I'm out 200 a month with the loan vs the minimum payments.  But, according to a amortization schedule generator, Even if I start increasing a credit card balance by 200 a month to make my budget work, because the principal payment on the loan is almost 500 the first month, I'm actually still decreasing my actual debt by 300 a month. B, pay off low balances. Eliminating minimums would put me only 140 behind.  Like before, even if it goes back onto a card, actual debt would go down 360 a month. Additional would be great for the credit score. Might allow me to get a even better loan in the nearish future. Could potentially negotiate lower card APRs due to high score? C, pay based on interest rates. Eliminating the highest interest rates first will shift my average APR lower. The lower I get my APR, the more of my money that goes to principal instead of interest. Likely to reduce my monthly payments the least. And because it only frees up the most expensive credit, if I needed credit for future emergencies, it would wind back up on the same card. I owe the following:capital one Statement Balance 1528.49   Min Payment 49  APR 20.05Citicard Statement Balance 2507.4 Min Payment 87.30 APR 23.74Chase Statement Balance 5175.52 Min Payment 122 APR 16.24Chase Statement Balance 13859.16 Min Payment 378 APR 20.24Discover Statement Balance 20182.56 Min Payment 397 APR 20.49 for 15k and 17.24 for 5k I'd appreciate anyones opinions. Thanks,","We're happy to help you think and do math... but not knowing your goal makes it a bit challenging. If it were ME,  I would pay off Capital One, Citi, and the smaller Chase balance, then send $4,000 to the larger Chase balance and the remaining $5790 to Discover.  It will cost you $137 per month, but you'll pay off three accounts and get the other two under 68.9% individual utilization.... IF they don't CLD you, and both are known for doing just that... be aware. If they don't lower your credit line, the new reported balances should help your Fico scores immensely which will HOPEFULLY result in better offers down the road. Can you afford another $137 per month? Good luck to you!"

"Hi there, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a lender that takes income in to consideration over credit. I went from making $120k a year to $30k 3 years ago.

I also have a $12k student loan that's past due and close to collections but they are postponing payments on that and I think I can continue payments regularly when they're due. One of the big issues I'm having, is my family and friends pretty much carried me for two and a half years when I was making $30k to keep me from losing everything. So I owe them about $60k and most of my paychecks go to paying them off. But lenders don't know about that. I But late December I got a pretty good job again and back to making $125k verifiable income and $10k of expected dividends for the year. So $135k. But I can't get anything. I mean I can't even get a $500 payday loan or $1000 line of credit. I'm trying to get $25-$30k debt consolidation loan.  So basically does anyone know lenders that are income based instead of credit based because I simply won't pass any credit criteria.

"I have multiple online-only High Yield Money Market Savings accounts that I've opened over the past few years.  Maybe I've been lucky but my overall experiences have been good so-far.  I've tended not to chase the absolute ""highest advertised rates"" since I know rates are variable.  Some lenders are known to offer ""teaser"" rates to encourage new business which don't last, or they don't grandfather existing clients when they run those promotions.  I've also read some horrible customer service experiences.  I've stuck to some of the largest and reputable national banks which have solid and competitive rates over time.  I just looked more carefully at DoC's monthly review of Best High Yield Savings which is an excellent resource.  I have three accounts earning 1.70% right now, but I see rates as high as 2.30%.  Many of the online-only accounts are affiliated with traditional brick-and-mortar banks.  By researching those lenders or their parent banks through the depositaccounts.com website or online reviews, I've not been impressed with the experiences of many of the higher-earning financial institutions.   Still, I wonder if I should consider moving some funds to one of these higher-earning FI's.    My question for this this thread is to ask for your experiences (both good and bad) with the leaders in this banking segment.   I've seen horrible experiences with trying to fund accounts, trying to speak to customer service, trying to access funds or limitations on access, and other such annoyances.  Go to the deposit accounts website to search for reviews on any online lender or their parent.  For example, Ivy Bank is the online affiliate of Cambridge Savings Bank in Massachusetts.   Brilliant Bank is the online affiliate of Equity Bank in Kansas.  CIT bank is the online affiliate of First Citizen's Bank in North Carolina.   There was a >thread< about one of our members negative experiences with TAB bank in 2019 but I haven't seen a lot on some of the others.   My own accounts earning 1.70% are with Goldman Sachs/Marcus, Capital One 360, and Discover.   I also have PenFed Money Market Savings that earns 1.20% currently, but I'm expecting that rate to increase soon to match those three more closely since it's normally been competitive.   The best-earning rates above what I have now from a lender who would appear reputable and reliable is E*trade Bank by Morgan Stanley, which earns 2.00% or Comenity Bread earning 2.15%.  Synchrony and Barclays both seem solid but only pay slightly higher than my best rate at 1.80% versus 1.70%.  In the past, I've considered an account with Citibank or Amercan Express, but their current rates of 1.65% are slightly lower than my top three.   For reference, here is a summary of the banks paying 1.40% to 2.30% on either Money Market Savings, regular savings, or checking accounts.

No real problems with either Vio or Barclays, easy to use and transfer funds.  Paramount is fine but APR is a little low, was originally higher than the competition, not now.   There was a time when CIT kept introducing new accounts, which you would have to open and transfer money to, e.g. (names made up) you would start withe Super Saver at say 1%, they would keep that rate but introduce Really Super Saver at 1.25%, so you would open that and move nearly all the money from Super Saver (not closing because suddenly Super Saver might go up to 1.3%!) and then they would come up with Max Super Saver at 1.5% etc.  Other banks increase/decrease rates, CIT introduced new products (as well as adjusting rates)"
"I pulled my Chexsystems report with in the last four months because I was denied opening a high interest account base on my adverse action letter.There were no derogatory info as it should. However ""Inquiries Viewed By Others"" was a different story. Here is what I found:More than 10 inquiries; the oldest going back three years.Four inquiries in 2021.Two entries are from banks I applied and was denied an account. That includes the bank that recently denied me then sent me the Chexsystem adverse action letter.Four entries are from incomplete applications. This is were I started an application for a bank account; but never completed the application. Of those 4, two are from banks were I never had a account. Two were from banks were I already had an account. Can any of these Chexsystem inquiries be disputed and removed from my report?","Under what grounds? Just because you didn't get an account with a bank doesn't make the inquiry invalid, by your description, there is no fraud, no one applied for these accounts under your name, etc. Now for the ones where you ""never completed the application"" it really depends on how far you went in the application."
"I just learned it's possible to earn Membership Rewards points for buying or selling a house. An outfit called RBN (Real Buyer Network) runs this program, in which they refer you to a handful of real estate agents, and if you use one of them to buy or sell, you get 1 MR point for every dollar of the purchase price. There are some hoops and fine print, but nothing that seems unreasonable to me.  TPG posted a fawning fluff piece about the program last year. Link. Does anyone here have experience with this? Pretty cool way to get a heaping helping of MR points if you happen to be in the market. Almost seems too good to be true. Mods: I'm unsure where to post this. It's not exactly mortgage, card or credit related. I think Personal Finance is the best fit, but no worries if you disagree.","Based on the observation that little in life is free, and that the points cost money (since no Amex card appears to be involved) I would wonder: 1) Referall fee:  agents have to pay this.   That coud be a source of funds, but I would also wonder if you really are getting top-notch agents, great ones don't need to pay (maybe)?2) Are closing costs higher than at some alternatives?  You could end up paying some fraction of the value of the points that way! But if not 2) and you get a great agent as claimed, AND trhere are no other gotchas, makes sense!"
Hi friends! I joined NFCU 6 months ago because I wanted access to some of their products. I'm a rebuilder so I wanted to use the checking account to build a relationship. But their checking account is sooo slow to do everything. Lol. It just seems like every transaction takes forever and coming from Chase and CapOne I'm just not used to that. I can live with it if I need to in the name of the relationship. But I'm just shocked at how slow everything moves.  to get their products down the road how important is it that I actually use their checking as my primary checking. I already have a secured card with them. I also recently joined PENFed. Have a tiny direct deposit going there bi weekly. Is there checking account any better?  Would love thoughts on this. thanks fico friends!,"Yes, I have found that NFCU is sometimes slow in those 2 departments.  With external transfers, though, if you are pushing a transfer from NFCU to an external account, I have found NFCU to be the fastest in the business.  As to pulling a transfer into checking.... you can't do it at all. Why that is, I have no idea. You can push a transfer to NFCU but there I would agree that it may take a while to become available. As to bill pay, it all depends on whether it's going to be electronic or paper check, and I have found that NFCU billpay is less likely than many other billpay operations to classify the payment as electronic.  But if you get it set up as electronic, they're as fast as anyone else. If you open an account at PenFed, though, you will see that for the first 6 months they are slow on availability of funds. After that they're lightning fast on everything. And they are super fast on pulling transfers."

"Hello,  My Wife & I have an annual combined income of ~150K, we both have 401K's (equivalent) and some IRA's. In the 401K's we have close to~1 Million. Our IRA's are at about 300K.

We have 529's for the Kids but I want to diversify in case one of them doesn't go to College. I was thinking maybe investing that in a ROTH? For tax purposes is this a good move? I figured that taking money out of a CD. that's making 0.5% and paying off the mortgage with a rate of ""3 point something"" is smarter.","I don't know about tax purposes but it sounds like a great idea to put the mortgage in the rear view mirror. You might get dinged in some of your FICO scores, but it doesn't sound to me like you need any credit."

Our financial advisor said that financially it doesn't make sense to pay it off: reasons include those already listed                   you can get a higher return investing                   inflation reduces the real cost of the mortgage                   keeping the money liquid for emergencies and/or good opportunities but she added that a major factor is psychological, and many clients do choose to pay it off anyway.   (She didn't add: ""don't come running to me if you do that and run out of money in retirement!"") We paid it off, and don't regret it (but we didn't not pay if off and might have been even happier in that scenario!).   I think one key question is how much money paying it off leaves.   If you would still have plenty left, the paying off seems more attractive."
"After waiting patiently for the past two years for the stars to align, I was able to qualify for eligibility through an employment-related path. While this credit union is still most definitely geo-locked to residents of AZ, my specific situation qualified for out-of-state membership. Had to go through multiple conversations with different levels of reps, and a lot of time and articulation to make this happen. So far in the credit union space, this is the most difficult membership I have worked for. (That's all the info I can provide folks!) Was able to get the Premium Rewards Checking opened before the end of the year to qualify for the 30K point ($300) new account bonus. Glad there is no DD required, I'll just need to get $1k in there and do 1 debit card transaction within 60 days of opening. Very happy to have this membership in place, as I plan to build the relationship with monthly deposits and then go for the Connect Rewards Visa when I'm 0/12 (in July). Need Costco regularly covered at 5% asap since my DW is spending up a storm there every month! For those interested, the eligibility requirements are still as follows: 1) Anyone who lives, works, worships, attends school or volunteers in (as well as all businesses located in) these geographic areas...Pima, Pinal, Cochise, or Maricopa CountiesGila River Indian Community ReservationArizona’s “Copper Basin” Area""2) Active, retired, separated, civilian employees, and military dependents of members of the United States Armed Forces who are stationed (or training) at/near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and other parts of southern Arizona. 3) Immediate family members of Vantage West Members 4) Current employees and members of some groups located outside of the geographic areas. (Even though they list a phone number to contact regarding group affiliations, they don't make this info available and still require AZ residency)[Note for AZ residents outside of the counties listes above, it appears that the GABA (Greater Arizona Bicycling Association) may still work, but definitely not for out-of-state residents!]","Congratulations. It's an excellent, no-hassle credit union.  Everything is fast and easy on their website. Their lending rates are super. You're lucky you were able to get in."
So looking for the next best Credit union to apply for a credit card  soon I have navy federal credit union and penfed is AOD good ? Are they Bankropt friendly?i have excellent credit and a bk form 2104,"I would put DCU in top 5 CUs!DCU no longer pulls HP for membership and if you have established relationship with them for awhile, you can qualify for their CC with SP only! They also have lower then average rates for loans!"
"Hey all, I'm looking into getting info on these types of loans and have a few questions. First, a bit of background, I have about 7 open CC that total around 20k of revolving debt. I don't have any loans or negatives on my credit reports and want to consolidate all payments and reduce the amount of interest I am paying.  Question 1 - Do I have to wipe out/close the entire balance on each card I choose to consolidate? I'd like to keep a 3-5% utilization on each. Question 2 - If I have a limit of 10k on a card and pay off 5k does the cc company reduce my credit limit in any way? Question 3 - how will my overall credit limit be affected? For example, if my spending power is 100k and I get a 15k loan will it be reduced to 85k? Question 4 - are there any reputable agencies that offer these types of loans specifically? Which rate is considered a ""good deal""? I have navyfed and alliance credit union any tips? Thank you all for your help!","Q1: you can leave whatever you want as a balance but I don't know why you would do that, especially if you are currently being charged interest Q2: depends on how much of a risk lenders think you are and what the risk tolerance of the lender is. YMMV situation Q3: I don't understand what you mean by ""buying power""Q4: credit unions can be a great place to start"
"I couldn't find a forum that seemed appropriate. If there is a better place for this question, please relocate!Here is my question: I have an Amex personal loan. It is an unsecured installment loan. I can pay it off early. Actually, I have paid it down to $200. But, I am not sure if it would be better to fully pay it off and close the account, or pay it down to a very low amount and let it continue reporting. I have done that second strategy with a personal loan from my credit union, and I don't have a payment due on it until 2024.There is a message on Amex that says if I don't pay it off in full by the next due date, which is August 12, ""interest will continue to accrue."" Will interest continue to accrue on the $200, or on the original loan amount? I assume on the $200, but it would be a nasty surprise if I'm wrong about that! And, will I just need to pay the $200+ off next month anyway, or can I let the $200 (or an even lower amount) sit there throughout the loan's term?Thanks!","It will just accrue on the $200. As to how long you can let it sit there, most lenders don't do it the way your credit union did, so you have to pay attention to what they are telling you is the next minimum payment and due date.  Usually partial prepayment accelerates the later payments. So you may not have a choice in the matter. Since this isn't your only installment loan, I'm not sure what you would have to gain by not paying it off.  If you have just the 2 loans, there's nothing whatsoever to gain from leaving the balance on the Amex loan. If you have more than the 2 loans, we would need to know the original loan amounts and the current balances in order to see if there's a scoring benefit from letting the Amex balance sit there."
I tried to sign up for an Affinity account and got all the way through it until it was time to fund my account.  My local bank wasn't listed on Plaid there although it is in Plaid for YNAB and that's where I have most of my money.  What do I do now?  It's annoying to go through Plaid.,"Usually there's an option to add the external account ""manually"", which will involve their making 2 trial deposits."
"Two weeks ago I checked their pre-approval tool to see if I am qualified for their credit card or not...and if I do then for how much SL...It came back that I am qualified for $23k SL on one of their credit cards...I didnt accept the offer because I wanted to be their member first. This CU is located in Northern California but their membership is very easy to obtain, and not geo-restrictive, and anyone can join thru Financial Fitness Association.. They even pay for the fee for a year's membership with FFA. So, I applied for the membership...a few hours later I got an email from them stating that my membership application was conditionally approved until I send them the documents they are requesting. They pretty much asked for the copy of my DL and SS card, and a selfie holding DL, and to send them the application for the membership with FFA...I submitted everything right away. Next day got an email saying that my application got denied for- My identity was not verified REMOTELY. I called them and asked them what was that all about or if they need any other document/information then I am willing to provide. But manager said- its just the typical response from their system whenever someone's DL is not from CA...He also stated that there is nothing to worry about...and that I need to have a virtual meeting with one of their bankers next day...I then had the virtual meeting on zoom...the lady on virtual appointment only asked to show her my ID right in front of my face and then she asked why I wanna join this CU when I live in East Coast...I answered her everything and my reasoning why I want to join this CU...She also asked me as to how I learned about them to which I answered from this site-Myficco... After that she said that everything seems good and that I would hear out from them after the Thanksgiving...but when I didnt hear from them until yesterday...6 days later of Thanksgiving, I called them yesterday evening and I was told that my application was reviewed and they still denied it. I asked-why...The lady over the phone couldn't answer me on why but said that she could make another virtual appointment so that banker could give answer to all my questions and can help me at the same time to sort out any problem that is preventing my application from getting approved and be able to approve my application. Today I had the virtual appointment but agent didnt even ask me to open my camera nor he asked any question except informed me only one thing that the back office (fraud dept) has reviewed my application and decided to still decline it. They want me to go to any of their branches in Northern CA with the ID if I wanna become their member. He didn't want to discuss anything further. So, I called them again and spoke with another rep. as I was hoping to speak with a supervisor/manager but this rep. told me that my DL wasn't even verified and that it doesnt seem to be from the state it was issued from....I said-what???? They are full of ........Making all kinds of excuses... Has anyone ever experienced this kinda dilemma, regardless of being in the same state or from outside of their state? What should I do now? How to tackle this issue? Thanks","Yeah I've been turned down by out of state credit unions for membership because they said they couldn't verify my identity.  Usually I don't even bother following up. I figure it's better that I not go forward, because if it's this hard to open a savings account with them, it will probably be worse if I ever actually need anything from them. I just recently had a situation where a credit union, after approving my membership, froze my account.  They then wanted a Zoom meeting to verify my identity and ask me a few questions. Just like in your case. I felt like withdrawing my application, but instead did the Zoom thing. Eventually I passed muster   Like you, I had to hold my drivers license up next to my face  It was the first time I'd ever heard of a Zoom meeting for opening a bank account.  Yours is the second."
"First off if this question isn't allowed or has been asked before, I won't be offended if the mods close this one out. This is a tough question to ask as I know that income amounts is a sensitive subject and folks don't necessarily want to share and by answering it could give things away, so perhaps we should answer in generic terms. In short, today I have money everywhere.  My wife and I have our own checking accounts, and we keep way too much money in her checking today.  I have piddly amounts in various CU accounts for different purposes and then a Schwab brokerage account and a 401K through my work and an HSA that at this point has surpassed the investment threshold so I could invest some of it. I just feel in general, that we are still very middle class by today's standards.  We are comfortable, only debt is my wife's student loan debt which is federal, (it's still a depressing $32k right now, we have about ~50k in liquid cash, but I look at that as the emergency fund, though I may look again at options for getting that knocked out, it's basically like having a car payment every month and no car).  Our other debt is the house that we will be paying on for a long time with a sub 3% interest rate. We could always do a better job budgeting or not doing stupid things with my money like gambling on Robinhood or Crypto (I only have about $2000 of play money for that, and I look at it as my replacement for Casino trips). I don't feel like my assets are great enough to have a financial advisor.  At what point did you consider a financial advisor?","I would never get a financial advisor no matter how much money I had. 1.  I don't need some other person getting into my personal business. 2. I feel you should only put your money in places that you understand, and should not put any of it in places that expose it to risks that you don't understand and/or are not willing to sustain.  Nobody's ""advice"" could get me to do otherwise. If I'm interested in investing in something that has some risk attached to it I would study up on it first. If I don't have the time to do that then I would keep it in a bank. 3.  Any financial advisor is going to have some agenda of his or her own."
"Caveat: I'm very new to all of this so please try and explain things like I am five if it's not too much trouble  I do my banking with Chase - checking and savings accounts both as well as two credit cards - Freedom and Freedom Flex. I have a...semi-decent amount in savings (five digit number) that gets a standard 0.01% interest rate. I've done a bit of reading the last couple of weeks and have come to realize that I could be doing better and have this money sitting in a high-yield savings account. It's only been sitting in my Chase account so if it's just going to sit it might as well be earning a better interest percentage, right? Are there any suggestions for high-yield savings accounts to place this money in? I value simplicity and really want to park it there and forget about it until there comes a point where I need it. The main two accounts I've read about are Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Ally. Because both of those are online-only banks and don't allow cash deposits, I'd keep a token amount in my Chase account for ease of convenience. I'd like to earn more interest if it's possible that I can. If anyone has an account with Goldman-Sachs, Ally, or any other bank that they like specifically that have higher than standard rates, what do you consider to be the pros and cons?","Hello again, @Fancy_Like.   Yes, if you've got five-figures sitting in a regular banking account, you're missing out!   There are a lot of good High Yield Savings Accounts available.  I've had the Marcus by Goldmans Sachs for years and it's a great account.    I have money spread around in others, though, for some diversity and to compare rates more easily as the markets change.  A lot of the major banks have them now including CITI, Capital One, AMEX, and Discover.  I have one with Capital One that I can access from the same sign-in on mobile app as my credit card, which makes it convenient.  If you later on add credit cards and banking accounts with either Navy Federal or PenFed, they have similar HYSA options that you can access through the website or app.   Some things to watch out for with these include:Some have minimum deposits to either/or open, earn interest, or avoid monthly fees.Some have minimum/maximum to earn the advertised interest rate.Some have fees for paper statements. Some lenders might offer a highly competitive rate as a teaser rate, and later bait-and-switch to lower rate.  (The major lenders like the ones I mentioned avoid these tricks.)  You may have limitations on the number of withdrawals a month, so plan accordingly.  Typically 6.You may have limitations on the number of accounts you can push/pull funds from and you may incur fees.   Read the fine print.

"Im hoping to get some advice from the community for my family member (younger brother). He is roughly $110k debt post divorce, and trying to pick up the pieces financially.

"I've been paying down all of my credit cards with my bonus this year. Question: Do I payoff completely or maintain a low balance on each, like $500? Which one has a high positive impact on credit score?","The highest possible positive impact on scores is AZEO, i.e. all zero except one.It is never beneficial to scores to carry a balance on a credit card.

Started a new business and as usual start-up cost was much higher than expected. Ended up putting around $40k onto credit cards to help get everything launched. Income is coming in slower than expected so wanted some opinions on what the best option is for consolidating?Currently have 2 cards maxed out totaling the $42k NFCU & Chase.Some consolidation loans I've looked into require proof of income and since this is a new business that won't work. Would appreciate any suggestions as to the best way to unwind from this mess. Thanks in advance!,"My suggestion is to get the NFCU & Chase cards out of maxed out territory, get all cards to 48% or less, then see where your scores are after the dust settles. Make sure you pay yourself on a W2, so when the time comes to apply for something you can submit recent paystubs as proof of recent income."
"Hi. I'm looking to get a personal loan for $6-8k for a medical issue I'm having. I know there are a lot of options out there, but I'd like to get some insight into personal loans. These are my scores after two months of getting them up from 615:  Experian: 746 Transunion: 741Equifax: 734  Other stats: * Account age is 4 years 10 months * 2 delinquiencies on Chase card from two years ago * Two credit cards (Chase and Discover)* 6 inquiries from 2020 because I was an idiot 20 year old who didn't even know what inquiries were when I applied for a ton of credit cards * Income is around $45,000* Other debt is $8000 on my car * No student loans * I don't pay rent* I'm 22. Not sure if that matters here, but it explains my short account history I did a bunch of soft pulls. Lending Point straight up said no. Lending Club said I need a coborrower (my mom has agreed to be that if needed). I checked SoFi, Prosper, and a few others, some a little shady than the rest. My brother is in the military and has Fed Navy.  BUT I want to know my chances without a coborrower, or just in general. I need a real adult who actually knows about this stuff just to level with me and advise me what the likelihood is of me getting a loan given my scores and history, or if I should just kick rocks and find another option. Please help because I feel like I'm just walking in the dark here.","If I were you I wouldn't go the loan route, I would get a credit card with a 0% promo rate."
So they kept enticing me with a $250 SUB via their app.  I caved in and signed up which was tres easy as an existing cc holder.  Process took like three minutes.  (Very slick with UI and UX.)SUB requires at least $250 DD twice within 75 days of account opening.  I plan to use this new account to pay to my Savor card.   I wanted to see if anyone is happy or indifferent or whatever with regards to their DDAs.,"When it was taken over by Capital One from ING Bank, it had been my oldest bank account and first internet oriented account. I loved the account and managed it cleanly. Then one day Capital One cancelled it for no good reason, other than that my much later acquired Capital One credit card accounts -- which had also been managed perfectly -- had  been closed by them. They refused to disclose the reason for closing the credit cards, even though they are required by law to do so, saying ""it was a back office thing"" and that ""the back office doesn't tell us the reason"". So I would never deposit money of mine with that trash bank. I imagine some folks will spring to their defense, but in my book they are a low class outfit."
"My wife and I have been on a rampage over the past 1-2 years wiping out some debts (none considered bad debts or in bad standing).  To-date we paid off a $40k car loan in a lump sum, bought our daughter a $13k first car cash, and this week we are down $100k in student loans.  Here is where we stand: 1. Mortgage owes $284k at 4%2. Student loans owes $136k3. Wife's auto owes $38k We are likely considered high income at this point, and we are considering our approach.  The student loans (we will NOT have any forgiven) are at 0% until January when they jump to 6%.  Our plan right now is to essentially pay off the student loans in the next 12 months WHILE putting an extra $5k towards the principal on our mortgage each month, with a lump sum anticipated to wipe out the auto loan in the next year.  This begs the question:  does this approach make sense or should we be throwing the extra $5k/month we have earmarked for the mortgage at the student loans?  Either way we track to be debt free (including mortgage) in 36 months, which we are pretty ecstatic about after I had a nasty divorce 10 years ago that took its toll financially, along with a couple of economic downturns leaving me making around $40-45k/year for a few years in the past decade.",1. Paying off your debts is a great investment!2. OK my advice is to throw everything at the student loans. Leave the mortgage for last.
"I've never had much of a relationship with PenFed. I ignored them as an old savings membership account when I PCSd from east coast to the west coast in the military where PenFed doesn't have much of a presence in Oregon. I opened a membership with them in 2008 and left it at that. Recently, I wanted to know why I never saw any offers with them and logged in looking for the offers tab not finding it. I noticed that the checking accounts are free now and thought 'why not' and tried to open one to deepen the relationship. It was then that I noticed this red lettering that I couldn't open anything and had to call. When I called and spoke to the rep she told me she only saw my membership starting in 2011 and not 2008. I asked why I hadn't received any offers and why it seemed like there was something wrong that I couldn't open a checking...she told me that my credit had been pulled from 11 years ago and hadn't been refreshed, that a hold had been put on it since that time and it was essentially a restricted savings account only, something I never noticed from the lack of use of it. She asked if I wanted to authorize a SP to see if the hold could be removed and I was floored that my CU had harry pottered me under the stairs for 11 years, but said go ahead. She came back and told me everything was fine, the hold was removed and advised to open a checking and that I would now start getting offers. So. I opened the free checking. I saw something reccommending I request a $500 ODLOC and decided to see if that would pull from the SP she had just done or if it was a HP (for science). Well...it was a HP, but it was approved, which was nice. I then decided I wanted a real relationship for my rebuild and wanted a basic card with them to help me do it. I was a little surprised that they would approve an ODLOC but deny a $300 Gold credit card. This CU is strange one I'm just beginning to figure out. Probaly should have done that years ago, but there it is. As a side note, it appears that I can request a transfer of funds from my ODLOC to my checking in more of a regular LOC then a ODLOC. I welcome any PenFed insights and tips and hope my experience is useful for others.","I totally agree with you that PenFed ""is a strange one"". I've been with them over 6 years, and I'm glad to have them, but yes they have a few peculiarities. I guess the best 'tip' I can give you is that they seem to be a little more receptive to 'recons' than other institutions. So you might as well try to recon your denial.  The first card I ever got from them, I was turned down for, and again turned down on recon. Then when they sent a customer service feedback survey I responded in detail, they treated that as a 2nd recon, and then reversed themselves and gave me the card."
"Hi all, I have been a resident in US for a few months and I am trying to build my credit, really appreciating this forum so far! Right now my only credit is an American Express charge card which I have had since I arrived through their global card transfer program, I put all spend on this and pay it off in full every month via autopay, within the next two years there are 3–5 credit cards I am hoping to get overall. In the meantime, I would also like to boost my score with a share secured loan (SSL), is anybody able to confirm that my approach here is correct? Open a PenFed savings account with a $5 membership depositAdd some additional cash for a share secured loan (it looks like $3600 ($25 per month for 144 months) should be a an easy longterm amount to process)Wait 30 days as per PenFed's requirement and open the share secured loan (over the phone, it is not listed on the website)Immediately pay the loan down to $320.40 (8.9%)Assuming an interest rate of 2.05%, set up automatic payments of $2.51 per month which should fully pay off the loan in the 144th month (a total of $41.04 interest paid, so an ongoing cost of about $0.29 per month to maintain a FICO score boost)Is this the correct approach or have I missed something? Also, might there be any better lender than PenFed for this (there does not seem to be any way for me to get NFCU) and are there any benefits to using any different numbers for the loan? For example if I do a $10,000 loan amount then might any credit card lenders offer higher limits based on this? Also are there any disadvantages to doing this? Thanks","It sounds like the correct approach, but I have no personal experience doing it with PenFed. I've done it only with Alliant and NFCU."
"HI all - First post here.   I recently took out a personal loan to pay off some debt.  I paid off my credit cards.  Now my question is I have an Upstart loan for Roughly 7500 left on it at 245.xx a month for another 41 months.  If i pay $7400, Will my monthly payment adjust so that i'm paying like $2 a month for the rest of the loan (41 months)?  Give or take a dollar or so.  That way my loan isn't closed early and I still get the payment History? I hope that makes sense.","1. You'll get the payment history no matter what.  It will continue to be reported in your credit reports, most likely for years to come, after it is closed. 2. I don't know what Upstart's policy is about how to treat prepayments. But I think the majority of lenders will update the payment dates, so that it wouldn't stay open on the books for long.  3. If you have no other installment loans, you could take the $7500, use it to fund a share secured loan with NFCU or PenFed, use the proceeds from the SSL to pay off Upstart, and then use the savings at NFCU or PenFed to pay down the SSL to $700 or less.  There would probably be a temporary score ding, but once you were showing no Upstart loan, and a mostly paid down SSL, you'll be good."
"My mother want to loan her grandson some money for a car. I know in the past there services that would let you put together a loan and they would process the paperwork as a more formal process and the payments would be made to that servicer, who would then forward the payments. I know Wells Fargo used to off a service like that 20 years ago.We all though prosper would be like that, but it didn't turn out that way. Are there any out there now? All I can find are business loans. If there are ones that would help my nephew by reporting the payment to the credit bureau that would be nice.","She could just cosign the car loan, and then he would be building credit with the car loan."
"I have found my local credit union to be non helpful when it comes to my financial needs and have decided to switch to someone else. I have a penfed membership and am thinking about them but wanted to see if I could find out more first and if they are a good choice for a main bank even with no branch access? I will not have direct deposit do they care? I have been a member for more than 6 months so are external transfers instant?  If not, what are the average waiting times for funds to be available? Mobile check deposits instant availability? If not, average hold times? Overdraft line of credit: Average limit with this type of product? Does it report to the CRAs? Are transfers from Premium online savings instant to checking accounts or does the 5 day rule apply? Thank you very much in advance for any information provided about this I appreciate it.",Well I just experienced something today with PenFed which I would say disqualifies it as being anyone's main bank. In fact I think it might disqualify it as being a secondary bank. I went to make a 2nd balance transfer on a credit card and got this error message: You've reached your daily limitwarningYou are allowed one balance transfer per day. This includes withdrawals and cash advances. What the heck?
"Hi everyone,I should be closing on my mortgage this week. It was a long road for me due to not so great credit but we finally made it. We had hoped to be able to take a renovation loan but that did not happen. There are not a huge amount of things we are wanting to do at the house because we are thing we will eventually flip it to an investment property or just flip and sell. It is a home we have been renting for the past 5 years and have now had the opportunity to buy so we received a great offer from our landlords, the sellers.  I would like to get opinion on whether or not it would be wise to apply for a personal loan to complete the things we'd like to do. Ideally I'd love to take out $15k but I would be happy with $10k. I do have a very high DTI though and I read some conflicting things. What is and is not included in your DTI when it comes to personal loans? I read somewhere that they do not include your mortgage but that just feels like false info.  If it is true, then my DTI is better than I thought haha. What kind of DTI will a personal loan be approved at. My scores are all just under 700. I make $53,350/yr with promise of a raise to $58,400 in January 2023 (I have a letter from HR). And I will also receive my first bonus in 2023. Cannot confirm it now since it is my first year at my workplace and I have not received one yet. How long after a mortgage should I wait to apply? And what would be the best places to start? I read on here a lot of people like Lending Club and SoFi. I do belong to a local CU but I don't know if I would be approved thru them with my current DTI being where it is.  Suggestions please?!","Once you've signed the paperwork and closed on your mortgage,  (keys in HAND!)  you can look into a HELOC. I'd wait a week or so tho..."
hi all new to the thread but not the forum. Where is a good place to put savings for a down payment for a house and an emergency fund. Two separate savings at diff banks would make sense right?  I have Pen Fed regular share and Navy Federal savings that they give upon membership both freshly opened last week. Although the PenFed is saying I have restrictions on anything other than the regular share they opened for membership right now. I was reading about the yield thing where savings gains money from sitting in the bank (I'm not familiar with it but trying to learn more). i am in the process of bk7 341 next month. newly started a job after being unemployed because of the pandemic for the last 2 years.  They give me the option to do 401k and Roths (not familiar with these either) after my 90 day period of working for them. Would it be helpful to use this too? Currently I have some cash that I need to put into savings for the house down payment with no plans on touching it for 2 years. I'd like to put a portion of my paycheck towards the savings where it comes out like a bill I'll never see ( bad spending habits previously so I figured this would be the easiest way for me to save). id also like to know if there is a great budgeting app or anything of the sort that I can use to keep track of my finances. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!,"Everyone does it differently, so I imagine that you'll get a lot of responses... hopefully, something will ring true for you. DW and I also have savings accounts with PenFed and NFCU, but we don't really use them. We've got a savings account with our small local bank, we both have our paychecks direct deposited to our joint checking there, then I manually transfer ten percent of our net pay over to the savings account. This method has worked well for us, but as I mentioned, I'm sure you'll get more ideas. Good luck!"
"I started my Credit journey June, 2021 with an average score of 580 to its current score of low to mid 700s (T.U, Experian & EQUIFAX). I am a PenFed customer so I thought I'd give a shot on a personal loan. Honestly, I thought I would be approved because of the 700s credit scores, current salary ($175,000), and no loans apart from Student loan.  I applied and got rejected because of the following reasons that they stated:  1. Debt Deliquency. A few years ago I owed $5000 to Santander from an auto loan. Got into an accident while in college, couldn't work because of the injuries; however, right after finishing school we came to an agreement of $3200 and they closed the loan. No other delinquencies. 2. Length of time accounts established. 3. Too many inquiries past 12 months. This is true since I opened two secured credit cards and a secure PenFed loan to build my credit. Then when scores improved.....I got unsecured credit cards with Apple, Amex gold & Platinum. 4. Too many accounts with balance. This I didnt  understand since all of my credit cards are within 6% -9% credit utilization. Is there anything I can do to improve my credit life and/or the above situation? Any tips are greatly appreciated","Yes. 1.  It improves your score to have most of your revolving accounts report zero balances.  So pay some or even most of your revolving accounts before the statement cuts. 2.  Don't apply for any new credit, or for anything that could trigger a hard pull, for at least 6 months. 3.  See if you can negotiate a good will deletion with Santander."
I join DCU was banned shortly after for linking 2 outside bank accts to shared savings acct. Fraud dept Flagged and shutdown acct.   looking for alternatives. please help,"Your best bet is probably to go local -- i.e. find the best credit unions for which you qualify in terms of geography, or in terms of employment or other affiliation. If I were you I would do some research on it, it's not always so evident.  E.g., Frankenmuth CU, which appears to be a great credit union in Michigan, and which is primarily local to Michigan, also allows membership to anyone who has been educated in Michigan. There are zillions of people all over, who have at one time or another gone to one of Michigan's many interesting colleges and universities. And by 'best credit union' I mean one that (a) offers products which you would like and (b) has good personalized customer service. Also I usually try to avoid those that do a hard credit pull on EX TU or EQ on membership applications. In a separate post I've advised you of a number of credit unions which are open to all."
"So for the past several months, I've paid down over 7000 in credit card debt but have a long way to go. My tactic was paying whatever that 3 yr amt that's indicated on the statement, and paying that same amt (not adjusting it downward month over month) And lately, I know I have paid down a bunch, but it just...doesn't feel good, as in it still feels like I am paying the same number of bills, and it's all money just going into a precipice. Especially those months where there's an extra day in the billing cycle and my interest amt goes up for that cycle. I am strongly considering going to a snowball method where I focus on my lowest balance, pay every other just minimum payment, and then all extra goes towards that lowest balance. But...I guess I feel bad about that? As in, I don't know guilt isn't the right word, but me suddenly switching from that 3 yr amt to ""just"" the minimum feels like I'm taking a step backwards? I got a lot of balances currently under a balance transfer offer, but the credit limits dint allow for me to consolidate them all in one quite yet.  Here's where I'm at:Keybank 11550/12500Discover 10438/12500Citi 5800/7700Credit Union Cc 11900/15000 I got a few other credit cards at 0 balances, but low credit limits and no bt offers. Any testimonials to doing the snowball method? What will help me is paying these suckers off, but none of them are low balances per se, so it just seems like what I'm doing currently is making me feel like I'm on a treadmill","When I was drowning in debt I made a hard decision to pay the lowest balance first and that encouraged me to keep paying and to increase the payments every time I had extra money. It took me over 8 months to get my act together but I am focused NOT to get in debt like that ever again (no more co-signing, that was a HARD lesson)!!! Best wishes on tackling your debt!!!"
"I'm planning on moving and wondering what currently are the typical requirements for renting from large rental companies that manage several properties. Specifically (in case someone from there knows) I'm looking at a couple luxury complexes in Reno, NV managed by Lewis Apartments.  I've been self-employed for years and typically I have to provide 1-2 years 1040's (instead of W-2) for proof of income.  In general I'm hearing last year's 1040 + 2 months bank statements is common?  And minimum credit score is usually no higher than 650 assuming there are no collections active and past evictions. I also read somewhere sometimes you can provide your credit report yourself and avoid a hard pull?  I would be surprised if many companies allow that as they would be trusting you aren't doctoring your report.",Interesting question. Would like to know what others chime in.
"The roof of our home has suffered hail damage. Contractor invites me to file a claim with our homeowners insurance to pursue a new roof. Much to our surprise, Home owners insurance meets with contractor at our home and readily agrees that roof needs replaced and approves the claim. Home Insurance writes a check made out to my wife, myself, and our mortgage company.   I call mortgage company seeking endorsement of the check.  Getting through the automated menus takes roughly twelve minutes.  I finally get a person on the phone who informs me that I'll need to speak to their insurance claims department, and he'll be happy to patch me through. Robo lady round 2. After WAY too many questions, the automated system volunteers to send me a link. I accept, they hang up.  (Never actually spoke to a human in the claims department) Link received via text takes me to a claims website where I establish an account and answer all of the same questions again, now inputting information via iphone. Received many congratulatory emails regarding establishing my account and claim. The next step is to submit the check for endorsement... and my iphone provided me with an address to mail it to.        Call me a luddite all you'd like, is there any reason that the guy at the mortgage company couldn't have simply given me the address to mail the check to? sheeesh.","Deck is complete, still waiting on final approval from the city.

"I currently use Alliant for my personal checking account but everything else is at Chase and Amex - Business checking, business CC, personal credit cards, and investments. I also have accounts with First Republic, Schwab, Navy Federal, and a few others that I don't really use anymore and I'd love to close. I know that banks like First Republic and Schwab Bank, alongside credit unions like NFCU and Alliant, get great reviews for customer service and features. But convenience wise, consolidating to Chase for personal checking and closing all the others (except maybe NFCU) would really simplify finances for me. I'd like to have two, maybe max three apps / accounts.To put things in perspective I'm late 30s. Applying for a mortgage next year but will likely use a broker. Biggest thing I look for in a checking account is ATM refunds but the Chase account will have that. appreciate any advice!",I like Chase for business banking.
"Hi everyone, its been a while since I posted here. I came to this forum several years ago with credit scores in the low 6's and a BK13 still hanging on my score. Time and following the advice here took me up to the high 7s and low 800s. Last year I was diagnosed with what could be a terminal illness. I got a little crazy and decided to burn up my 70K in credit card limits with the thought I would just let my credit fall. Still have the wife's scores and she was in the low 800s too. After the last time with credit ruined, we kept all our loans and cards separate so one of us would have credit if needed. Well, I got about 47K charged on the cards all going towards work on the house. I got some trees cut and a driveway put in. With the thought the improvements would help the wife sell the house if it came to that. I started getting adverse actions with Amex, Wells Fargo, and Discover both taking my limited down to just above the balances. This brought my utilization up to pretty much max on some of the cards. Well, of course, it turns out I'm a lot better with my health than I was last year and I thought might maintain my credit. The utilization was the only thing hitting me, no lates or other baddies, so I knew if I could move around the utilization my scores would rebound. So I applied and received a personal loan from Best Egg. Since my scores had dipped to the 600-650's, I got a 10% interest rate and had to pay a hefty loan origination fee. Since they were the only ones to approve me. So I took the loan. I needed 47K to take care of all the cards, but they would only approve 37K. I paid down the cards I really care about like Amex and Discover and paid down all the rest to either 0 or at least halfway. The Wells Fargo and Capital One have about 56% utilization on them and my overall utilization is 25%. I waited until everything posted although I did not account for interest on the Amex and Discover so niether of them reported 0 just a small amount on each, so I only got 3 of my 7 cards reporting 0. Checked my scores this morning and they are all between 717 and 746. I am getting dinged for the Best Egg account that was reported before the month was up. When I took this loan, the plan was to have my CC's report reduced utilization and allow me to get a better rate with another company. So right now my youngest account is 1 month and that is dinging me. So now to my questions. Would you wait a couple of months and let the Best Egg age to the 3-month mark and then try for a better rate card or would you go ahead and apply for another one now? I also thought of trying for CLI's from the cards that are 0 now to further lower my utilization or should I just let sleeping dogs lie and not try to get any of the limits I lost back to help with utilization which should get my scores back up to above 750?  Hopefully, this is clear. What are your thoughts on how I should handle this? I can make all my payments as is right now so not worrying about default or late unless I get back sick. I don't like a 10% interest rate especially since they are likely going up the rest of the year as the Fed tightens.",My experience has been that getting individual accounts which are above 50% down below 50% can pick up some real points.
"Hello everyone, I was recently approved for a PenFed PCR card about a month or so ago. I made a payment this past Monday and the next my available credit reflected the payment. Well I was looking over my accounts with them today and noticed that my available credit had dropped significantly so I phoned up customer service to found out why this had occured. Keep in mind the payment was made from my PenFed checking account with available balance funds. I was told that all accounts with PenFed have a 5 day hold in place before funds become available for 6 months. After 6 months this hold policy is lifted for the client. This seems a little extremely to me but I understand the credit union protecting themselves from possible fraud.  I have several checking and savings accounts with other credit unions and banks and have never ran in to this type of policy before. I was thinking of making PenFed my main bank but seriously reconsidering that idea. I am currently looking at SDFCU to open accounts with them.  I use Zelle pretty regularly to transfer funds from one of my checking accounts to my daughter's. She is at another FI that uses Zelle and it just amazes me how fast those transfers are. She is currently a full time college student and doesn't have a job due to her college work load. Just thought I would let others who are thinking of joining PenFed know about this 5 day hold policy they have in place before opening accounts with them. I will am very curious to find out how fast the funds become available after the 6 months period is up. The CSR did tell me that this hold policy does not apply to direct deposits (such as employer payroll deposits). I will see on the 28th if this holds true. Credit_Master","PenFed is a good credit union, but it has its peculiarities.  Apparently you've stumbled onto one of them.  I never experienced it because I never use a credit card like that for anything remotely approaching the limit, so that the amount available would not be of importance to me. I seriously doubt what the CSR promised you will come true, because the payment of the PCR credit card won't be coming from the direct deposit, it will be coming from the bank account into which the direct deposit was made. Despite its peculiarities it's one of my most useful and reliable financial institutions, so I wouldn't give up on it too quickly.  But if you're going to use it as your 'main' bank, I guess you need to find out about the peculiarities, to see if they conflict in a significant way with the ways you do your banking."
Does anyone know if Penfed PLOC pulls Experian or Equifax?,They pulled Equifax when I applied.
"Hey all! I took a shot at an auto refi with PenFed last week and was approved! Super excited to start a relationship with them (opening an checking account as well). My question is, how long should I wait before trying to apply for a personal loan to consolidate two upstart loans with an absurd interest rate? I tried their preapproval site about 2 months ago and was not preapproved. Just curious if this new auto loan will help my chances in the near future. thanks in advance!",IMHO there is no relationship at all between a credit union's willingness to give you a mortgage or auto loan and its willingness to give you unsecured credit. Every credit union I've joined has been manic about trying to sell me an auto loan or mortgage. But there's no reason to wait if you think you have the credentials to get the loan.  You can often get a preapproval from PenFed.
"my primary bank is alliant credit union and they're amazing to me: fast bill pays, reimburses my ATM withdrawals several times a month, among many things. I also have a side credit union i use, however, that credit union started to charge me fees when I withdraw from ATM as well as their own fees, which i have started to dislike. Anyone have any recommendations for credit unions/online banks where they will reimburse a ton of ATM deposits, have fast bill pays, have no need to put any money to maintain a fee free account? EDIT: not a fan of NFCU either thanks","There are so many great credit unions out there.  But I have no experience with ATM fee reimbursement, as I never need that. Almost always if I withdraw cash from an ATM I use either an ATM from my institution or an ATM which is in a fee-free network used by my institution. So my method of tracking down what you need would be to check out credit unions,  just go to their website, click on a search for ATM's, and see if the network(s) they use have good locations in my area. E.g. langleyfcu.orgClick ""locations""Search for fee-free ATM's in your zip codeI see Walgreens, CVS, Target, Riteaid. And some McDonalds's and credit unions. And at unifyfcu.org I get the drug stores plus 7-11 stores and some mcdonalds and credit unions."
"Anybody with feedback on UNIFY FINANCIAL CREDIT UNION in California? All the feedback on here is really old. I would love to get some feedback regarding membership; credit cards: service; etc. They are local to me and seem to be along fhe lines of a ""community"" credit union. I should be gardening right now so a credit card would be way down the line,  but you never know when a specific credit union might offer something enticing. I applied online on 9/5 (Labor Day), and got the message that my application is under review. I called three times, and got a little info each time. 1. Their ""back room"" is overwhelmed. The CU does not sound very automated. 2. They do not do a HP for membership (unlike Los Angeles Federal Credit Union down the street which does a HP for membership).3. They pull Chexsystems.4. Once fheir back room gets to your app, they email you to upload documents. I haven't gotten the email yet so I cannot say what they need.5. If you don't respond to their request, they cancel your app. I think it's 30 days. I'm at that stage now, and need to consider whether to proceed. 6. I have no idea if they are geofenced. 7. Phone service is quick and polite. Any real world feedback?","I think they're a great credit union. They used to be called ""Western Federal Credit Union"".They are totally automated.They're not geofenced; they're open to everybody.They acquired a credit union that was based in Roseland NJ, I think it was McGraw Hill ADP Employees. So they have a presence in NJ too.It's a long time since I applied for a credit card with them, but at the time they pulled EX FICO 2. I like them just fine. In my experience their underwriting was more generous than most credit unions, and their APR's low."
"Or is it better to just stick with chase, bank of america, the big banks, etc? Thanks!","1.

What's your advice on on DCU, SOFI or any suggestions for my places to apply for the loan. Thank you!","I would recommend doing it with a credit union. Usually the best credit union rates can be found with your local credit unions with limited fields of membership.  So shop around and join a good credit union in your area that has favorable personal loan rates, or a good no-balance-transfer fee platinum card, and that doesn't do a hard pull for membership."
Hello all!  Not sure if this is posted in the right spot or not. I have an offer for 18k personal loan @ 26% for 3 years. Score not that great 697 Experian 656 transunion and 687 EquifaxThis loan would be used to pay off other loans/ cards at higher rates.One loan 7k left  is 35% still have 4yrs on itOne is 29% 3.5k left 2.5 years left and the 3rd is 25%  2.5k with 18 months left.One card 19.99% 3k balance One card at 29% 1.5kIt would be one payment instead of 5Would also save me about 50.00 a month that I plan on putting toward the new loan to save a little interest on it.Thoughts please.,"Yes Credit Unions are the best way to go! 4 Years ago I was in similar predicament as you, but could not get any banks to give me a Personal Loan. I went with Penfed with 15%. Consolidated bunch of CC debt to one loan and then got under 10% loan with Service CU! As my Fico Score went up, I was able to consolidate everything to one loan at 3%. I believe within couple of months you can get much better rate then 20s"
I joined NFCU back in Dec 21 and only made deposits into my only account which is a Savings account. Today I attempted to withdraw some funds to my external bank account. On the screen that shows it says From: and I clicked my Savings account then when I went down to the TO: part the screen shows my external bank account but it was unclickable. Is there some secret trick to getting this to work? No biggy just testing for when I do a withdrawal later down the line. I will give them a call probably later today but just wanted to see if any early birds (it's 4 am right now) might want to chime in if they have experienced this before.,"Agreed. Transfers out, on the NFCU site, need to be from checking account. Must first transfer from savings to checking. Otherwise you would need to pull the transfer through your external account."
"Hello all,       I started taking SS benefits at age 62.  Now I am back to work earning $45K which I know is over the $19,650 threshold. I know there's a $2.00 over $1.00 you earn or something like that. My question is how do I calculate thatand how do I pay back any over payments?   I'm now 63 and past the suspending my benefits. I just started this new job3 months ago.   Thanks.","This is a completely different thing than referred to by the OP.   At any age after 62, if you are taking social security, the above fed taxation applies.   What the OP was talking about was the reduction in benefits from working (before full retirement age).  Yes, there is also the reduction for taking the benefits early, but that happens whether you work or not.   At FRA, income has no impact on benefits (but of course does on taxes)"
"On July 1 I mobile-deposited a tenant's Chase cashier's check into a Chase checking account. Yesterday I saw a little red circle and a message saying ""We put 1 or more transactions on hold."" and it shows the amount of the check. It says the funds will be available July 6. If the tenant is at risk of NSF, then I'm confused as I thought a cashier's check meant funds had been earmarked and set aside to ensure a transaction would go through.If Chase is concerned about the risk of fraud, then I'm surprised as the pay-from account, deposit-to account, amount, and timing are very regular.And since the payor and payee both have Chase accounts, I don't see how Chase could be worried about the paying bank's solvency or doubt the check's authenticity. What might be going on?","Normal business hours...a little bit after noon Pacific. This tenant has been paying by Chase cashier's check for nearly a year, and Chase hasn't delayed the funds like this before."

"I have a question for the forum. It seems like there is an inordinate amount of people on this board who are members on NFCU, with more reporting joining near-daily. I'm just curious how so many people are getting membership. Do we have that many military/military families/DoD employees here? Doesn't seem like laws of large numbers support so many of them members here being in that group. And I know there were people who go tin through the loophole when it was open. Just like to know if there is something I'm missing.","Yes, the qualification net grows quite quickly.  When I joined this forum and heard all the praise of NFCU I thought that would be good but I can't get in...  I was very briefly tempted with the loophole, but didn't bother.

"So I just took out a personal loan of 12000 at 11.3%. The first payment is not due until July 30th. A credit card that I have has just offered me a balance transfer of 5.8% and that rate stays until the balance is paid off. Meaning there is no time limit to have it paid. The fee is only 2%. Obviously, I pretty much know my answer is that it is a smart move. My main question is how to personal loan companies look at this (in this case Goldman Sachs) if the loan is paid off before the first payment? Thank you","80% utilization on one card will hurt your scores, regardless of how low your aggregate utilization is."
Sounds like a good deal if you're within 12ish months of paying off your loan(s) and can afford a higher payment. May help some save on interest! AODFCU rate madness,I received a few emails over the last couple of weeks about this.Definitely a good deal if you're looking right now!
I recently join service FCU about a week ago applied for cc now they say send POInisent docs and last 2 years of tax returns now they say they didn't receive I sent it twice at email they gave me. Thinking bout Joining Interior FCU as a replacement. What u think I should do?,"There are good credit unions which aren't willing to lend to me.  That doesn't make them bad credit unions  I like Interior because (a) they have good products, and (b) even when they denied my application, they gave me good, personalized, customer service. Sometimes I quit a good credit union because I don't think they want to lend to me.  Hanscom is in that group. It seems to me like a great credit union. But their underwriters don't seem to like my kind of profile. I probably applied for credit with them 5 or 6 times. Eventually I gave up. Some good credit unions which have been willing to lend to me and are open to all are PenFed, Langley, Unify, Affinity, Evansville Teachers, Digital, BECU, Alliant, and Chartway."
"Cash back debit card accounts are a dime a dozen. Almost all the ones I have heard of fall under the Kasasa brand and have a lot of hoops to jump through to get the cash back. For example, you may have make 12-15 signature debit cards transactions and have a $500 or direct deposit to qualify for the cash back. Affinity Federal Credit Union is unique. It has cash back debit card account with no strings. It does not appear to branded or affiliated with the Kasasa brand. You get 1% cash back capped on $1000 spend for a maximum $10 cash back per month. No minimum debit card transactions and no direct deposit requirements. Are any other cash back debit card accounts, like the one at Affinity Federal Credit Union, with no strings attached. Preferably anyone could join?

"Hi everyone,I have 37k in my savings account and have been saving for a mortgage down payment for a while now. I am able to save about $1000/month. I currently just have it sitting in a regular checking account, not doing much of anything. With interest rates and APRs/APYs raising, I have decided to 1. Hold off on a home purchase for now and keep saving, and 2. Do something with this chunk of money while it sits. I have been looking into high yield savings accounts, etc. but just don't know a lot. I want to make this chunk of change do something if I can while I am saving for a house. I am thinking at this point, I am AT LEAST looking at a year out from a purchase, if not two or more. Any advice and suggestions are appreciated!","Two separate things.  Among no-strings accounts, Alliant is currently well behind the leaders.   It's around 45th on the list Best High Yield Savings Accounts for November 2022 | DepositAccounts behind many well-known names such as Capital One, Discover, Ally, Barclays  and Sync (OK, some may not like that one!).   And even among these, which are far from the rate leaders, the difference is a much as 0.65%, which on a 2.35% base is quite substantial.  So no, Alliant is not ""invariably among the leaders"" unless we widen that definition.  And some of the real rate leaders have been pretty stable over time. My point about brokered CDs is that currently provide a quite good rate for those willing to do such things.  Alliant's 12 month IRA is 3.45%, again quite far from 4.75% So basically not sure why the love for that particular institution!"
"I hope this question isn't being asked in the wrong place but is it good for my credit to get a CLOC from NFCU? I'm in the process of my build and have the NRewards, 2 Certificate's, savings, checking, and an SSL already. Would it be smart to add this or should I wait?","I don't think you need it but it's possible that it fills out your credit mix.  I would wait and see if your credit mix is less than ""excellent"". If so, you could add that. It's good as a protection against checking overdrafts. It winds up getting scored like a credit card. The interest rate isn't great, so if possible it's better to have it but not to use it."
"Hello Again Everyone! It's been a LONG time since I've posted.. I haven't really needed credit for anything lately, and still don't, but do need some advice on what to do with our savings. We saved up almost $30K because we were planning to buy a house this year. Unfortunately, prices are so ridiculous where we live ($650K+ for a 2-3 bedroom) and we needed my mother-in-law to move in with us immediately. We ended up renting a house from the same landlord we've had for almost 10 years and all moved in together. So on to my question: what should we do with this chunk of change? It's just sitting in our savings account accruing like $1 in interest LOL. I'm not well versed on the savings programs or what's even offered, so some advice would be greatly appreciated! Also, I don't forsee us needing this money any time soon. We both have great jobs and together make about $150K - $180K per year and I would like to continue adding money to our savings.  Thank you all!","Exactly, so they want to be your primary bank.  All of the accounts that pay well above the averages of the long-term dominant players in this market have strings attached whether it is direct deposit, minimum balances, maximum balance to receive the higher rate, fees, etc. There are also a lot of lenders that bait-and-switch getting consumers to sign up with a really awesome rate, then later eroding the earnings or otherwise devaluing the account. Sofi is a fairly new player in this market so time will tell if they remain as competitive. (They changed to the checking+savings with direct deposit model just a few months ago.). Meanwhile there are a handful of banks that perennially offer among the best rates with no/low fees or no minimum deposits. That includes the ones I mentioned like Goldman Sachs Marcus, Discover Bank, Capital One Bank , PenFed, Alliant Credit Union, and a few others such as AMEX or CITI high yield savings.  I usually recommend sticking with the institutions who have a long track record and don't play games."
I need help deciding what to do.Im not great with money and I am trying really hard to get better but as a newly single mother of 3 it is very hard. I do budget but i've had to use my sinking funds for other things. So the Christmas fund was gone a couple of months ago. I did not plan very well for Christmas and I dont have money for presents (its my own fault). I have charged a balance on most of my cards. I was supposed to be paying them off every month but that has not happened.  I have been trying to save because I will be moving next summer. I am bad at saving so I put about 8k in a CD at an online bank. The penalty to close it is the interest I've earned no extra fees. I need to pay off my credit cards I've charged up about $2700  and have money for Christmas.I want to buy a house next year and I do not want my DTI to be trash so I really dont want a loan payment showing on my credit.  1.Would it be best to Open a CD at Navy Fed and borrow against it? the interest rate would be between 7%-18%2.Take out a payday loan or title loan (so it doesnt hit my credit)3. Just use my savings I dont know when I will be able to build it back up,My advice would be to pay off the credit cards.
"Hey guys I applied for a penfed card since the last time I tried in 2017... conditionally approved but it says ""member has a negative share balanace"" I'm assuming that's what's holding the approval... what's the fastest way to deposit money in Penfed?.

"Hello everyone, Fairly new here, need some advice and heard these forums were a good place to start.  I currently have 2 credit cards, 1 at 17,000 at 17% interest and 1 at 8500 at 12% interest. I make approx. 8500 a month, but have quite a few financial obligations which has left me making minimum payments. My credit score is approx 710 and I have used about 50% of my available credit. I am looking for a way to try and get ahead in the next 2-3 years or at least limit the interest fees I am paying. I make approx 400 dollar payments on the 17k but incur 270 in interest per month. I rent, have 2 car payments, have a spouse who can work minimally due to health issues, and thankfully have great health insurance. After a fairly conservative budget I am left with a few hundred per pay check if I am lucky. I am looking for recommendations for possibly consolidating debt while I take appropriate austerity measures to pay down this balance and just wanted some ideas, I am not terrible with money but not great. I appreciate any tips or ideas.  Thanks!","My suggestion would be to join a good credit union and apply for a lower interest debt consolidation loan.

"Recently I got approved for NFCU second card with a credit limit of $1000...So, I received a letter from them about my internal score which is 251 but that shocks me a lot because I have Flagship checking account with them for many years that I use all the time, Saving account for many years...Money market account for so long...Pledge loan for so long... CD for a year...My whole salary is being deposited as DD each week for so long....and have a credit card with a CL of $49k for last 3-4 years...My question is not about why I got so low SL, rather why my score is slow with them when I pretty much have almost everything with them?? Its seemed to me that its a myth when people think or believe that having as many as accounts with them would raises internal score with NFCU...7-8 months ago I got the same internal score with them which made my application for Flagship cc got denied...Something doesn't seem right in this picture....My Fico score is 829 and utilization is less than 1%...

I recently opened a Savings account with Penfed. I want to start my relationship building with them and am looking for suggestions about the best way to go about it. I also was happy to learn that they give your EQ Fico for free. Unknown to me when I tried to access it I found out that a savings account does not qualify for access to your score.

I would like to open a CC with Penfed but want to establish a good relationship first,"I find it fascinating that their list of accounts which qualify for viewing the credit score omits their only good account, the premium savings account.  It seems to me that the easiest way for you to get the credit score would be to get (a) the free checking account and/or (b) a debit card. As to relationships with financial institutions, I always smile at that thought, because I never feel I have, or ever could have, a ""relationship"" with any of them.  But of course if you want to build a track record with them, the more accounts you have with them the merrier, as far as they're concerned.  And they will all love you to death if you deposit lots of money, getting no or low interest, and at the same time borrow from them, paying much higher interest. And nowadays they really seem to love people paying for things with their debit card, a practice which I consider inadvisable."

My cousin showed my aunt, who got emotional and wanted a copy. My grandfather's daughter, so I let her keep my copy.I went to the website August 8th. Ordered a new copy on updated form. There's no longer a separate site for older records. I received an email this morning, telling me documents were ready to download. They now send you a password protected copy, with digital seal. You have 30 days to access documents before they expire. I'm shocked they located documents and sent them in less than 2 weeks. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up. I haven't seen anyone mention this change.","I definitely thought it was worth mentioning. I spoke with an Archives Technician about getting physical copy, instead of it being emailed.

"PLOC = personal line of creditOLOC = overdraft line of credit attached to checking account to stop overdrafts If you shopping for a line of credit, is there a reason to choose one over the other? Are APR typically similar? I am leaning towards a oloc because of the automatic handling of overdrafts. The oloc at NFCU has checks that you use. Does that make this product a hybrid: OPLOC (overdraft personal line of credit)?","They're both personal lines of credit. I find the overdraft type more convenient, because it saves me the step of transferring from one to the other. No matter which kind I am using at the time, I never use the special LOC checks; I can't keep track of those the way I can keep track of regular checking account checks and tranfers.

My wife only has revolving debt accounts since her car loan was paid off and dropped off her file.   I just opened a AmEx Personal Loan for her to get some points from a credit mix perspective and was wondering what the utilization thresholds are for Personal Loans? I seem to remember that somebody had a data point that when their balance on installment loan went under 55% there was a good bump in points?,"It is possible to have an 850 score without any installment loans, open or closed, in one's portfolio. So if the only reason for the loan is to improve her scores, I would skip it.  (I forgot, you already took out the loan. So the main thing now is to pay it down to 9%, and hope you can keep it open for a good long time). The passage of time + no new applications + no new accounts = score growth."
In the past few years I've taken out money from my cards for business this way and never had any problems buying money orders from USPS or Walmart for large amounts but now both Walmart and USPS have stopped accepting these prepaid debit cards. I took out 40k because in Puerto Rico I know the USPS was accepting these for money orders up until end of last year so I figured I'd fly over there and cash them... nope... they've now joined other parts of the country and won't take them. I didn't do it for points so I'm willing to lose a percentage at this point but what would you guys say is the lease expensive way to turn these into dollars? I can buy gold online and sell them back to the merchant but thats about 10% loss. I think I've seen websites that offer to buy them but they're about the same amount. Are they at least safe to work with? Can I send Western Union to myself using these and would the fee's be less since they can be used as debit cards?    Mod cut - this cannot be discussed here,"The 2nd Stimulus payment to me last year was mailed to me as a pre-paid debit card. I just went to PNC Bank and had them debit the card for the full amount and deposit it into my checking account. No fee, no hassle."
"I recently opened a membership with Affinity but I am also itching to join Liberty (formally Evansville), but I'm worried that doing so so quickly might be an indicator for fraud. Should I wait a month to be safe? Or is this too cautious? It's widely known that certain banks and CUs will pull a Chexsystems report. According to DOC's page:Almost every time you open a new banking account, your information will be run through ChexSystems. Other banks can see these inquiries and most of them have an automatic fraud level. If you have over this fraud level of new accounts opened within the time frame (usually twelve months) you’ll be denied for a new account. Does anyone have any DP that suggests a threshold of some sort (DOC estimates 6-8/12, 6-8 new accounts in 12 months)?","If a credit union is chex-inquiry-sensitive, you should probably wait until at least 3 months have passed, but I don't think ETFCU -- now Liberty -- is a stickler for that stuff."
Does anyone have any recommended financial institutions for high interest rates for RCA?,"I use Bluebird and Cash App.   These are ""free"" in that I can use the balance in Bluebird to pay a credit card bill and Cash App can just return the money to your bank account.  Using Amazon reloads costs a tiny bit in that you could have been earning more (5% with Prime credit cards for example) on those reloads."
"Hey guys, Always enjoy reading everyone's input and advise. Am needing to apply for a personal loan around 60k for out of pocket medical expenses and education expenses. My current FICO scores are 724, 713, and 712 respectively. According to the simulator, if I get a new credit card, the scores will jump between 15-25 points across the three scores. Am also aware that the simulator is not the most accurate according to diffetent posts I have read although the past two months were pretty much dead on when I used the simulator as a strategy. Should I go ahead and apply for a new card with the hopes that my scores approve for when I need the loan next month?Or should I just apply for the loan now not risking that getting a new card will actually lower my score? thanks guys!","There's no one size fits all answer to your question. Speaking very generally, if your profile is very very thin, it's possible that the addition of a new card will increase your score. More likely is that your score will decrease before possibly improving at some point down the road."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't find a personal loan section of the forum so I hope this works.I have a personal loan from upstart with a crazy high APR, it was a $5k loan and has a $3700 balance. I'm able to pay it off in full but should I? I assume the answer is 100% yes to save myself a great deal of money however I want to make sure it isn't going to negatively effect my credit score in some way I'm just not aware of.","In that case you are unlikely to experience any point loss at all from paying off your personal loan. In fact, you may receive a point gain. (What's at play:  1. Your aggregate installment utilization will not be significantly affected either way, so no point loss or gain there.  2. You will have one less account with a balance, so there may be a point gain from that.) BTW I disagree with the mantra finances > FICO.  IMHO optimizing one's FICO scores is an integral part of one's finances. So my mantra is the less poetic ""Sometimes FICO > finances; sometimes finances > FICO; it depends"".  I think when people say ""finances > FICO"" they are saying ""FICO is a tool for improving your finances, so improving finances is the real goal; FICO scores aren't an end in themselves"". And I agree with that. But a master craftsperson sometimes has to spend money to care for his or her tools."
So I have a military star card with a $5k limit. It currently has $2800 charged on it. Would you pay it down to 5% ($250) usage OR pay $500 a month and put the rest of the money into savings? I've paid $2000 on it in the last month (yes it was almost maxed). The goal is to buy a house here but I'm wondering what would be the best route to take. Thoughts?,"Better to just pay it off.  Just make sure you let 1 credit card report a small balance before you pay it off, rather than have all credit cards report zero balance."
"Last month wife and I paid off some Navy Federal debt. Three credit cards totaling $7000. A CLOC for $3000. And a debt consolidation loan originally for $28k. We made one big payoff payment of $11k. I was expecting our credit to take a hit giving that it was only a 36 month loan. And we paid it off like 10 months early. But last week I got the ""itch""(to open another loan) an jumped the gun before any of the accounts updated on our credit report. In my defense I did asked the customer service woman if she thought it was a good idea smh.... about 10 minutes later we were denied. Yesterday we received a flyer(generic congratulation flyer) in the mail from Navy, saying congratulations on paying off a loan. And saying to think of them for another loan. And today all of our scores just dropped 30 points. From the loan closing. Not sure what to do. Should we call and see about a recon. Or should we wait and see what happens to our scores. Navy federal should know that we just paid them. So would they take that into consideration, when reviewing our account? Honestly just looking for a direction to go with this. Would a new account help or score or lower it more?","1.  Opening a new loan now will not help your score. 2.  Getting a new loan would either have no effect on your score or slightly lower it. So don't do that to help your scores. 3.  From what you've described, I have no idea why your score dropped.  If the credit cards you paid off were your only credit cards with balances, and they reported at zero, you probably experienced the ""all zero"" penalty, which is easily cured by letting one card report a small balance before you pay it off."
"Hello,  I recently talked to a Financial Advisor that informed me that there's tax implications involved in Drawing from 401K's upon Retirement. He said that the idea is to convert 401K's to IRA's upon retirement then convert them to Roth's. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the tax implications and how that conversion lessens the blow. Could someone please explain this to me?Thanks.Joe","You will be taxed on withdrawals, you will be taxed if you convert the Traditional form to Roth. That's the basic nature of these Traditional contributions plans. You pay tax when they eventually exit the Traditional account structure. You got the tax free contributions, and the tax free gains over the years. Enjoy the income and understand the tax will be due The ""tax bracket"" basic calculations provided in earlier comments in this thread are sort of correct, but it gets more complicated because we do not owe income tax on the first dollar of income. If you postpone taking Social Security, it is possible to draw $20,000 a year from a Traditional retirement account, either 401k or IRA, and have the deductions and tax bracket lead to zero income tax. Marginal rates do go to higher rates, but that's applied to the last dollars, not all the dollars earned. Whether you can leave the money in the 403b after you retire is a question for the plan administrator. It is quite possible you can leave it there."
"Hi All, I am wondering, when do you decide to end a banking/credit union relationship?  I have a few credit union relationships where I don't see much value moving forward with. NASA FCU - Great they give Fico. Lending is conservative, Checking requires parking $2500 so have savings only. I originally wanted a star trek card but they feel I have too much credit already. AOD FCU - Great small CU. Not a fan of the online interface, lacks zelle or popmoney. Mostly been using it to send/receive facebook payments. They denied me a CC way back because of too much credit and some bs about deferred student loans being bad ... in the middle of a pandemic!SecuMD - They have just been ticking me funny. been a member since like 2020 savings only. Tried to open a checking but they were adamant about chex and that my report didn't matter along as I had no bad entries ... then denied me for too many inquiries. Ticked me off an existing member, not like I was applying for membership, felt lied to. I applied for CC back in 2020 denied for too much credit. Then recently applied as it seemed like they were loosening up, and they offered me $5k. Appealed and learned today it was denied.  Can't even figure out the CEO's email so I can complain about the bait and switch being lied to about the chex.  I mean it costs me nothing to keep them around, except time to move money around. But in the case of SecuMD/NASA they could never become anything more with just savings since your allowed what 6 debit transactions a month? In all 3 cases, they don't seem to offer any great APY products, so not like there is value add there. Like DCU or Redstone FCU for example.  So when do you decide to move on is the question? Do you just keep everybody incase someday you want to use them? Credit unions are a dime a dozen, where one doesn't lend, another will. At the moment I am not looking for anything new in banking along something really special comes around. I actually recently joined UnifyFCU which was bumpy and needed some CEO intervention and they are really cool, great interface, great people to deal with. It has been awesome!","NASA FCU has some good points, which may or may not apply to you. 1) Certificates.  They sometimes have very good rates (their specials) among the highest out there. Not currently the case! 2) Credit card.   In FotM time, these were great, 30K credit lines with just a SP.   Now generally S/D, but for the last two years they have a promotion, spend $1000 get a $100 back (or $25 for $250, $50 for $500).   As my card is a flat 1.5%, this is 11.5% on $1000, worth keeping.But if you don't have the card, better deals out there!"
"Hey Fico Fam ! , So wanted to get your guys opinion on citi . I have there Custom and Double Cards without any issue but not sure on the feedback for the savings account. I got a targeted email offer that im thinking of taking advantage of since for the past 2.5 years or so I've had my savings with my personal credit union not paying out anything. In the past I've dealt with discover and amex between 2016-2019 with no issues but when rates tanked i pulled out. Trying to see if the signup bonus be worth dealing with and trying to get back into a higher return then what i have now. After some research showing they could be a nightmare. Aiming at the 150 SUB. Thanks in advance .",You can do better elsewhere. If I were you I would deposit it with PenFed premium online savings account or Alliant Credit Union regular savings account.
"I am considering taking out a Penfed SSL within the month. I've read through a lot of the forum posts about SSLs but still have a few questions. I spoke with a Penfed CSR and was advised that prepayment does have an effect on maturity date and that I will have to make a payment of at least $25 each month despite payment in advance. If I were to choose a 60 month term for $3010 and then immediately pay down to 8.9% (approx. $2735), I can make 11 more payments of $25 before I pay off the entire amount. Can someone with recent experience confirm that prepayment will lessen the loan term or if it will remain the same with due date being pushed up? I am not necessarily doing this for the score bump as I currently have 2 installment loans (student loan and auto lease) reporting. I want to establish a positive relationship with Penfed and maybe in the process improve my EQ FICO 9 (50 pts less than FICO 8) and/or Penfed internal score so I can qualify for better credit products.",1. Don't do it if you don't need the score bump. Not worth opening a new account over.2. Your having an SSL with them won't mean a thing in terms of your future applications for credit products.3. CSR's can't be relied upon to give accurate advice over these things.
"I honestly have no idea if this is allowed in this group or not. If not I totally understand. My daughter got baptized a week ago and she is our first child. I have zero ideas what to do with the money she received from family and friends. Should I buy bonds or use a certain bank for a savings account with a good APR, CD's or open a certain account with a certain bank? Things like that are mainly my question. I was seeing if anyone in here has any advice or see what others did for their own children. I obviously want to do something with it that will help her out.","Yes, I would second a 529 plan depending which state you are in (some are better than others).   The only potential downside, apart from potential investment losses(!), is if your daughter doesn't go to college, or a private K-12 school.  If you eventually have a second child who does, you can change the beneficiary of the plan to the second child.  Otherwise, withdrawing the money for non-qualified expenses is like an IRA penalty, you pay taxes on the amount, plus 10% penalty, and the state may impose more. So OP: look at your daugher who just got baptized and decide if she is going to college (or private k-12)!"
I want to open another high interest checking account with the Bank of Missouri. Does anyone know if they run chexsystems? If yes how sensitive are they?,"I recently opened accounts with them through SOFI, and had no problem, and I had tons of recent Chex inquiries."
"Hi Everyone, Maybe someone can give me direction.  My FICO scores were in the mid 700's.  History:BBT - Bank for both my business and personal checking accounts.BBT and Suntrust were merged with Truist in late February.  The hell begins.My business account is connected to Quickbooks and my clients are charged for and paid through this method. Some also pay through Stripe.My business vendors are paid from auto debits from the business account. Business account pays me through my personal checking account from where my personal bills are paid.   Apparently, the new firewalls with Truist were/are not connecting with Quickbooks on a consistent basis for many bank clients.  There is no commonality as to who this impacts and why.   Several of my personal bills were sent back two times!!!!  Despite all attempts to resolve the problem, bringing in Quickbook experts and the regional manager of Truist, we recognize that the problem seems to not resolve.     I have five 30 days past due on my credit report in May which caused my FICO score to plummet. The bank wrote me a letter for my creditors and the credit bureaus explaining the situation and how it is clearly their fault, not mine.  I have no idea how to approach this.  I am an Experian member and called their dispute department. The person there could not follow my concerns and told me to go online to dispute the claim. I also called each creditor and they told me that I have stellar payment history and to write a letter to their dispute departments.  The bank manager tells me that this will all work out in the end.  However, I feel like I have a long journey ahead to fix this problem. I am buying a house in late summer and need my good FICO score back.  Are there any suggestions on how I can move this process along?   FYI -- I have moved banks as of last week.    Thanks in advance for any sage advice.",@Momtotwo9 Welcome to myFICO forum and so sorry this has happened to you. I will private message the Executive Office contact for Experian and TransUnion. They have been super easy to work with and quickly resolve my issues. Equifax on the other hand was absolutely NOT willing to budge. Please keep us posted as many others will be able to provide guidance to you. Best wishes on resolving the issues in your favor.
"I just had to jump on the bandwagon. Applied for membership, not and instant approval for me. I had EX locked and it gave me a 24/48 hour review notice for the app. I have since unlocked EX.  I didn't get a hit on the other bureaus yet either. We will see what they pull for me in California. After membership (if approved) I will apply for that darn card. I was trying to not get another account, but this was too tempting with the number of EX pulls Globetrotter83 already had showing. I will post what happens next.",I boarded the train as well but went pending with 24-48 notice.  I thawed EX before applying and so far no HP.  I'm in Ohio.  I had EQ and TU on ice though.  Probably should have thawed those as well before applying.  Will update when results received.
So I just opened an Access America checking account (goodbye DCU and it's new crappy system) to further my banking relationship with them (shooting for the PCR eventually).  I was curious for those who have it if transfers from other FI satisfy the direct deposit requirement or if it has to be a direct deposit from your employer.,"Right.   It is relatively rare (twice a week max for me) that you have to bet your life on what is considered a DD, but certainly check from time to time that you are still getting the 2% you expect.    If at any point Penfed stops considering ACH as DD, there is probably no recourse (it ISN'T direct deposit!) apart perhaps from walking into a branch, slapping a teller's face with your glove and demanding  a duel to the death..."
"Never noticed that the customer service for my credit union is outsourced ""PSCU"" . looking into alternatives as i dont like the foreign outsourced center this is actually a first i came across this situation. Does BECU also do this or is their customer service in-house?","I agree with you that PSCU management is undesirable. It seems to have gotten worse and worse in the 5 1/2 years that I've been exposed to it. My impression of BECU is that it's a hybrid -- I think some of BECU's credit card service is outsourced to PSCU and some is not. E.g., if you want to do an online cash advance to your checking account from your credit card, that's done in house. PSCU wouldn't even know what you're talking about. Whereas if you want to do a balance transfer, it seems to go through PSCU. I'm not 100% sure of that, though. What I am sure of is that their balance transfers were inordinately slow, one taking as long as a month to go through. The fact that you can't pay a BECU credit card with an external transfer payment also suggests to me that the credit card service is outsourced."
"Anybody familiar with the Ivy Bank Indexed Savings Account. The rate automatically changes each month based on the Treasury yield:  https://www.ivybank.com/savings(On a mobile, click the slider to get to the Indexed option) Anybody know if there are times when online savings accounts are generally higher than the Treasury yield? That would be the only reason I could think of to not go with this.","Ivy Bank was at the top of my recent thread I started about High Yield Money Market Accounts, @mediocrebadguy.    I also noted them and researched them a bit (learned about Cambridge Savings Bank also as @Dinosaur mentioned) but no one commented about IVY or the other top contenders.    My experience on-the-whole with these types of funds is that the segment leaders frequently change over time.  A lot of new names pop up regularly, and I think sometimes they are trying to build business with a teaser rate that fades over time.  Noteably, in reviews on some of the top names on my list, I also saw reported issues with customer service or difficulty funding or accessing funds.    Chasing the absolute top rate-of-the-month can come at a cost.  It has appeared to me that sticking with some large established lenders may be a superior experience while still earning close to the highest rates you (might) achieve with less-dependable long-term returns.  As I mentioned in that thread, I have accounts with Goldman Sachs Marcus, Capital One 360, Discover Bank, all of which dependably pay very good rates, have ease-of-access via web or mobile, good customer service, and in some cases are easy to watch since they are in the same account displays as some credit cards.  I also recently opened an account with AMEX.  See >THIS LINK< for some reviews on IVY BANK from depositaccounts.com. (9 out of 18 reviews gave them only one star.)  I've found that is a good website to research lenders you may be considering.   If you do proceed, please update the community on your customer experience!"
"I have done a search on the forum and I can't seem to locate any posts about NFCUs Digital Investor service.  So I figure here is the place to ask. I am looking to start investing some money in the market and, since I am a member already, the service looks to be a good fit for me.  But I haven't any experience with investing other than an old deferred compensation plan that I cashed out years ago to fund a business.  Turns out that was a poor investment, but that is a story for another time.  sigh. NFCU Digital Investor has a $3.50 /month fee per account,  no minimum investment to start, ability to buy fractional shares and what appear to my inexperienced eye to be low transaction costs.  My intent will be to buy and hold some index funds and maybe a few individual stocks after I get myself comfortable.  I already have two pensions (one I am already receiving and the other will start paying in five years) and I hope to be able to collect my Social Security when the time comes.  I have a small 401K that I am maximizing the employer match for, as well.  I'm looking to build a savings that will return higher yields than a savings account or CD but be accessible if needed sooner than when I will eligible to start pulling from my 401k or HSA accounts without penalties.   The positives that I see with Digital Investor are that the bar to entry is low, I have NFCU membership and the checking account already set up and the fees don't seem high.  I don't have the experience to identify the negatives. Do those of you that have experience with investing have any thoughts, advice, cautions, etc. that you are willing to share?  I really appreciate it.","1.  Stocks are risky; I wouldn't put money in stocks that I'm not prepared to lose.2.  Since you have a 401k, depending on how it's invested, you may already be subject to stock market risks.3.  Transaction costs in consumer type brokerage accounts are not always transparent... e.g., the spread between bid and asked prices. Some brokerages are better than others in reducing that.4.  I wouldn't pay a monthly fee to have a brokerage account.5.  Chase bank offers a trading account that has no fees at all on transactons.6. One of the risks of stock market investing is reliance on a single stock or small number of stocks, so that particular part of the risk can be reduced by using no load mutual funds instead of individual stocks."
"Hello, I'm looking for some advice regarding the SSL technique using NFCU to add a 60 month installment loan on my credit file to boost FICO scores, add to credit mix, and be positioned for a potential auto loan or similar within 5 years. I currently have no open or closed loans, so it seems like this technique will be useful, but I have some details to share to make sure and determine the order in which I should take certain actions. Currently, my Ex FICO 8 score is 790 and TU is 781. My EQ was 776 when last checked 07/21. Nothing negative has occurred since then, so the latter score may be a bit higher now. I have two revolving CC accounts. One is Capital One Platinum -- product changed to Quicksilver -- ($600 CL secured to unsecured) opened 5 years and 6 months ago. The other account is Discover it cash back ($5,200 CL unsecured) opened 4 years and 2 months ago.  My overall utilization is at 4% and no individual card exceeds that level. I have no new accounts since the Discover it cash back CC app and no hard inquiries on file. My AAoA is 4 years and 10 months. The youngest and oldest ages have been provided above. As mentioned, I only have 2 revolving CC accounts in terms of credit mix. I have made all payments on time and in full. There are no major issues on file from financial mismanagement/hardship. I feel like it's time to add some accounts and diversify my credit file. The NFCU 60 month SSL seems like a good step forward, but I'm thinking about applying for a new CC such as an Amex BCE (pre-qualified) around the same time. My concerns are the order and timing of these apps given the hit that I will take to my AAoA. If I apply for one or the other, my AAoA should still be above 3 years (~39 months). However, if apply for the second, I think my AAoA would dip below 3 years for ~7 months.  Given the concerns, assuming I apply for both the SSL and CC, which do you recommend I do first? My AAoA will lower if I apply for the CC after the SSL, but the SSL may offset that and help with the credit mix portion of my score. Adding a new account prior to the CC app concerns me given my prior experience of ~40 drop in Ex Fico 8 score after my Discover CC app. It took almost a year to rebound. Perhaps that was due to having such limited history at the time. I want to have the best look I can for the CC app -- which I think is more difficult to get approved for than an SSL. It is my understanding, and I could be wrong, that neither a soft or hard pull is done for the SSL, so perhaps the AAoA won't matter if I applied for the CC first? I'm also curious how my first CLI would go with the CC if the SSL is in place first and dips my AAoA as discussed. I've heard Amex ~61 day CLI's can be substantial.  To be sure, as of today, does the option to take out a NFCU SSL for 60 months with an initial payment of ~92% and small monthly payments for the remainder of the term still exist today? Also, I've heard about getting knocked down to a 36 month term for a little over ~$3,001. Would ~$5,001 increase my odds of a 60 month term? With all that said, do you recommend I go for both of these apps or just one or the other for now? I'm curious to hear your thoughts and appreciate any help with this.","My advice would be not to bother with the SSL.  Your scores are more than high enough to get the lowest rate on anything for which you apply. Since you seem to want to stick with cash back cards, the BCE is a good choice.  But if I were you I might want to go for one of the Chase Freedom cards, since a Visa is accepted in more places than an Amex."
"I have a puzzling question. Since some banks and credit unions are chex systems inquiry sensitive, if you happened to apply at like 20 different ones in a day all day would they all be approved and opened at once being you have clean record, being too fast for each bank to notice you just opened accounts? Or would that not work?","I'm not even sure the number of inquiries goes into the Chex score.  The last time I looked at my report I had a great score, but I had been turned down for a bank account because of the number of Chex inquiries."
I received an email today from NASA about a $300 bonus for opening their echecking account.  There are stipulations on it that require DD jd 15 debit card purchases per month.  It also mentions ways to not have a monthly fee including bill pay.  Here are my questions. 1.  What kind of debit card purchases would you use to make 15 small purchases a month?2.  What do you use bill pay for?  What are the best ways to use it?  I pay bills on the company's websites so have never used bill pay.  I just want the bonus and already have other accounts with them.,"I believe (PIN or Signature) basically means everything, debit card transactions are one or the other.   That said, if using Amazon you need to indicate to run the card as a debit card. Personally, on another account, I use Bluebird and cash app loads.   I do 15 a month and then the apps can put the entire amount back into a bank account (cash app) or do a credit card pay (Bluebird).  I no longer use Amazon as there is a ""real"" cost, I am giving up earning 5%, even though it's on a small amount ($7.50 a month, so about 37c!)"
"I was reading on Reddit and a user stated that their paycheck is split 3 ways - the direct deposit puts a portion into an account for bills, one for personal spending, and one for savings.

"In the past I have posted about the relatively high rates offered by USAlliance.   But in a rising market, there is an issue!  I have some 18 month IRA CDs and the penalty for early closing of certificates with maturity of 18 months or above is 360 days, which is way above market norms.  According to available calculators, it is just worth my while to break them, e.g. about $100 on $110K if I invest in a 3% CD","Fidelity currently has brokered cds at 3.3 for both 24 and 36 months. So while 3.25% sounds pretty good, is there going to be another string of anti-inflation rate increases?   My problem is that I have these two 18 month certificates from US Alliance that paid the then great 1.5% (only a few months ago).   Now breaking them is SO expensive.   If I was looking for longer terms CDs (now 1 year is my max) I would check early termination fees and I would accept a slightly lower rate for a better policy!"

What I do know is that I will get the loan from one of the credit unions I belong to: - NFCU- Kinecta- UNIFY- Golden 1- WESCOM  i am considering joining Alliant Credit Union.i also plan on immediately paying back 50 percent so my remaining balance does not result in ""loan balance too high..."" on credit card applications. Any advice/suggestions would be most appreciated.-","Absolutely you should get a share secured loan from NFCU.  Get it for a large amount with as long a loan period as you can, then immediately pay it down to 9% of the original loan amount.  That will help your scores for as long as the loan lasts."
Just curious why some banks (credit cards) let you automatically set up an account to pay your credit card with while others make you either do the plaid which is great when it works but when you have to do it manually and wait for their few cents deposits? just wondering? example I had to add a payment to a capital one account (helping my son dear lord) and I could pay from it right away . I added an account to my PSCU account plaid wouldn't work for penfed😞so I had to do manually and wait for deposit to post . Is this because it's a credit union and you can essentially transfer in between the banking accounts?,"I haven't found any pattern to this. With some institutions it's easy. With others it's a royal pain. With others you just can't do it -- any credit unions which use PSCU to manage their credit cards only allow you to have one external payment account at a time, and if you want to change accounts, it takes 5 business days to go through. Madness."
Trying to determine which is the best option for a pool construction?,"A home equity LOAN will offer you a fixed amount, a fixed payment, and a fixed term. A home equity LINE will offer you the option of using some piece of it, half of it, or all of it, and your payment and terms will vary. I don't know that one is better than the other.   IMHO, the disadvantage of a home equity LINE is that it CAN affect your credit report like a credit card... using the entire line looks like a maxed out card on one or more CRAs.... that's determined by the lender and how they report. The advantage of a home equity LINE is that you can use it, pay it down, and use it again if needed. If you are not certain of the cost of pool construction, a home equity LINE might be a better option for you. We just took the HELOC route to put siding  on our home... we'll pay on it for a year or two, then use it to replace a deck! Good luck!"
"For those who have these cards, do you ever choose the Debit option?","Only to withdraw money from ATM. Other than that, noway!"
"Hello all, I'm approaching my 30th birthday at the end of this year, and I've been thinking more heavily about my overall finances vs being so fixated on my credit score and rebuilding. I've spent the past 3-4 years slowly rebuilding my credit profile after a wealth of mistakes made in my early twenties. I've learned a lot about myself and how credit works throughout the process - I also will never tank my credit again knowing how hard its been to slowly rebuild. My next focus is setting my finances on track for entering my thirties and being able to have a healthy emergency / savings fund to rely on vs my credit cards. I still am working on letting my new accounts age and taking care of the credit I currently have, instead of acquiring more. I know that financial wellness comes from savings and staying within a budget, which was not something I understood up until recently. A lot of my friends have perfect credit and have made smart decisions because they were taught to do so by their family, considering myself a late bloomer but proud that I've put in the hard work - I'm getting there. I'm looking for feedback for best ways to stick to a budget, and keep growing the small emergency fund I've built in the last 2-3 months. I've reduced my overall spending as much as possible and am looking to take a higher paying job or pay raise in the next few months. My goal continues to be reducing spending, bringing in more income and getting my debt to a low point.  Summary of my overall finances / statsIncome: 85K + Bonuses, 401K Balance: 6KEmergency Fund Started 12/1/21: 1K (adding 100$ a month plus any additional income)No assets such as a home, or property - renting  Credit Summary: Avg Age; 2yrs 4months; Fico Scores are around 640-650 across bureaus. Overall Limit: $17,200, UTL: 45% (Working to lower this to 15%)Student Loans: 15K balance Personal Loan: 3K balanceCar Loan: 20K My main goal is to not take on any additional debt for the next year +, and drive any outstanding debts down while adding to the emergency fund & savings. I'm tipping the scale towards paying myself and getting out of the circular motions of paying debts. Life goals include paying off my car, traveling a lot more and having enough income saved to avert any sort of large debts. I know this Forum has lots of opinions about generating savings, paying debt and setting budgets - I'd greatly appreciate any feedback / if I'm on the right track. A few years back I wouldn't imagine of putting myself first financially, which is why I got into trouble 8-9 years ago. A constant reminder to myself that I can enjoy my life & career successes much more if I pay myself first.","Right, certainly individual stocks are risky and/or need a lot of research, but index funds are much less so.   Not without short-term risk of course (I cleverly did a small Roth conversion last month, paying the tax, only to see the value drop by 12%, oh for the era of recharacterization!) but for the OP time should grow the investment with fairly little risk, just have to get things right at retirement.  But the advice to check investments in the 401(K) is good.  Even though it's currently a small balance, new contributions will keep it growing.   Just make sure it is invested in something sensible and cheap.   A lot of firms default to some type of target date fund, which can be OK or not so OK.   If there is a low cost stock index fund (there might not be), moving new contributions there would be better. Obviously someone like OP who has been rebuilding, and now wants to focus on some ""grow my assets"" strategy, so as to have a decent emergency fund and buy a house, retirement may well seem very secondary.   Sadly, one day it won't, and the key is to balance today's needs against what will be needed in the fairly distant future.   The answer is to have a great deal of money and take care of both, but that isn't available to most of us!"
"While searching the forum for credit unions with early direct deposit, I came across PenFed's Free checking account--thanks @SouthJamaica. Submitted the app online & received the notification to unfreeze my Equifax report. Unfroze my report & received an email stating that my new account is almost open & that I may now refreeze my Equifax report 🙄. According to a chat rep, the application is under review and a decision will be delivered via email tomorrow.  So I'm thinking this free checking account may be denied as I joined in 2020 with a dirty file & my Equifax report leaves much to be desired. If so, I'll probably take my pennies from the savings & close the account.","Holy cow, I didn't even know PenFed now offers a free checking account. It's been the only credit union I've ever seen which doesn't. Its Access America checking account assesses a $10 month penalty, which can only be avoided by having, each month, a minimum balance of $500 or  direct deposits of $500.  It appears that their definition of direct deposit is the looser kind, apparently can be satisfied by ACH transfers from your external account."
I am pretty far along in my rebuilding process.  My scores are 802 and 810.  Up from 590-600.  I have some decent credit cards now and about 45k available credit.  About 1% utilization.  I joined NasaFcu and got preapproved for $30k PLOC.  Im wondering what effect this will have on my credit scores.  I only have credit cards in my cresit history. No installment loans or mortgages.  Will this help with variety? Will it increase my available credit helping my utilization even more?  Will a personal loan be better for variety?  Car loan?,"It's treated just like a credit card.  If you don't use it, it will just be reported as a revolving account with a 30k limit and a zero balance. So yes it will reduce your aggregate revolving utilization percentage. I don't know for sure, but I believe it helps your credit mix, as it's a revolving account that is not a credit card. With your superb scores, you should not add an installment loan for the ""variety"".  You don't need it.  Yes it's possible you could pick up some points in your FICO 8's and 9's by getting an installment loan -- specifically a share secured loan from NFCU or PenFed -- and then paying it down to 9% of the original loan amount. But again, if I were you I wouldn't.  I would keep things clean and simple. IMHO you're on your way to 850."
"Hello everyone, I am seeking help with figuring out the fastest way to transfer money from my Ameris Bank account to my PenFed account. I use Zelle through Ameris to tranfer money in to my daughter's account with Wells Fargo and it is instant. I love this feature but unfortunately PenFed doesn't offer it. I have external accounts set up with each bank and it usually takes about 2 to 3 days for the transfers either way to process. Does anyone know of a workaround to make this quicker? I am looking at opening an account at State Department Federal Credit Union in the future because they offer Zelle and it is so convenient. Thanks,Credit_Master",In my experience the fastest way to do an ACH transfer to PenFed is to pull it through the PenFed site from the external account.
"I've just submitted my savings/checkings application to SRI Federal Credit Union online, and went through the process of using an app called ID-Pal to submit ID, utility bill, and bank statement. Just waiting for them to get back to me whenever. Eligibility via Financial Fitness Association membership. Reason for my application is that I saw their Visa cards, and want my foot in the door ASAP. There are some exciting things about their cards. All have 0 BT/CA/FT fees, the low-rate card's APR is 5.75%, and the list of benefits are LONG!!! (not sure if all benefits apply to all cards) Here is an excerpt from their website. They provide all disclosures up front on their website which is very nice.https://www.srifcu.org/visa/   Visa BenefitsEnjoy extra protection for travel and purchases with Visa Card BenefitsVisa Card Benefits apply only to Visa Credit Cards.

I hope not. Does anyone have experience with them? UPDATE:Sent them an email asking whether the benefits are all valid and available on all their cards.","Congratulations on getting their gold card. I too broke down and applied for the platinum card. They asked for documents, which I supplied. Now waiting. I looked up the gold card, just in case I wind up with the same option that was handed to you. Actually, it's not too shabby.  No cash advance fee, no balance transfer fee after the 90 day intro period, 0% balance transfers for 15 months with 3% balance transfer fee during 90 day intro period, 9.9% fixed rate interest across the board."
"15k loan pre-qual denied for not being able to verify education??  $120k income, used them for three previous loans, always paid off within 24 months.  Is the education verification process new?  Is it electronic?  Not sure why they had a hard time verifying it.",I too would be curious to know why they declined based on eduation. Unless you indicated a licensed professional like a Doctor /Health Care professional Or Certified Engineer / Architect then they might want to check the licenses. Otherwise I am not sure why the education comes into picture. Share any details if you come across.
"I think the currenty fallacy is that the only way to build wealth is by doing it by buy and hold long term in the stock market. Is it possible to do it in real estate, particularly if you start early. You just have to be able to buy affordable properties and with time build equity in those positions. Hold onto them as long as you can as rentals and use the equity for your next down payment. Let's say you can get first time homebuyer 0% financing at 6% at a mortgage that is 1,000 a month. Use the extra money to pay down the mortgage and refinance it to 4.5% once you have 20% equity in the property. Then take a HELOC on that property to put money down on another property, pay off the HELOC and repeat. You can still be subject to a housing market crash but if the prices aren't too high you should be able to ride it out over the long term. At least you wouldn't also be getting killed on the market at the same time.","Speaking from my experience with a commercial apartment building in Los Angeles County... A lot depends on where you live. If you have a bad tenant in a state or city where the laws and courts favor lenders over landlords (like CA) and tenants over landlords (like NYC), you could be in for a lot of pain if you rely heavily on debt. It can also take a significant amount of time and effort to learn all applicable housing regulations, as well as to find good contractors. And even then, you're subject to those contractors being able to retain good employees. A lot of good electricians and plumbers retired during the pandemic, and with low unemployment employees know that as long as they quarter-ass it they won't get fired. An electrical contract that should have taken three or four days ended up taking four months. The effort in building and maintaining a good network of contractors takes some degree of scale to pay off, and getting more properties will take a long time if you don't have a lot of equity."
