1,"""I'm 52 and about to retire.  Should I get long term care insurance?  On the one hand, getting insurance for a big expense makes sense, and long term care can be a big expense.  On the other hand, LTC insurance seems like a relatively new kind of insurance.  I hear many insurance companies left the market since the payouts seemed to be higher than expected, so they were losing money.  Then the regulators allowed companies to raise rates -- a lot.  Going forward, who knows what will happen.  Also, there are apparently lots of terms and conditions.  It may not cover the first N months of stay, but that might be from when you notify the company of wanting to use the benefits, not when you first enter long term care.  Also, new types of care that may become popular, even standard, after your insurance contract was written, may not be covered.  I believe there were cases of this in the past, for """"memory floors"""" of LTC if I recall correctly.  So all of this can get confusing", it won't be me sorting all this out
2,"""A response to the thread about a gentleman's elderly mother running out of money got me thinking about this.  If you have no children and no close family, how are you thinking about and planning for end-of-life?  That is the boat my husband and I are in - no children, no close family.  My husband is a very super-active, still happily working and (thank God!) healthy 75. I am 61.  I have been asking for years how people are thinking about this likely reality but most either have kids who will/will have to take over. One woman we know is depending on her niece -- even tho' she and her niece aren't particularly close and the niece lives 3 states away!

3,"""My son's a HS junior in Illinois, definitely chosen CS as his college major, good student but probably not competitive to get into the tippy-top CS programs (3.7 unweighted GPA, albeit it with 9 AP/dual enrollment courses so far; 35 ACT; a couple decent math extracurriculars).   We've been very upfront with him, since freshman year or before, that we'll have in the neighborhood of $150,000-$160,000 for him to go to college -- basically using the projected cost for an engineering degree at UIUC as our guideline. And we've made very clear that we aren't signing any Parent Plus loans for him and that we'd discourage him from getting the federal loans as well (although ultimately that's his decision). We've had friends who have had problems when they didn't set up financial expectations early with their kids, so we really made an effort to do that with him.  UIUC's a great CS school, and for a time we were assuming that's where he'd end up. But then I heard that the straight CS admission rate for UIUC is in the single digits, and then his school counselor showed us (anonymized, only weighted GPAs and ACT/SAT) the results from his HS for the 2020-21 class for UIUC CS and it was...disheartening. (She said that 2021-22 was even worse, but she didn't have the results compiled yet.)     Anyway, so he and I are trying to come up with some other CS colleges that might be good options for him to apply to that are around $40k a year (and ideally lower). Here are a few that we have:  * Purdue, a little above $40k a year, but heard from the counselor that our CS results from there this year were """"disappointing"""" * Utah", automatic scholarships gets it down to about $25k/year * Illinois-Chicago
4,"""Update (09/06/2022) -- house officially sold for $446,500.  My wife and I just sold our house for $451,500.  The purchase was contingent on the inspection.  We just got the inspection report back and the buyers want a $5,000 credit to fix the floors on the first floor.  I am somewhat taken aback by this for two reasons:  1. The issues with the flooring are glaringly obvious. There are gaps in the vinyl plank flooring probably an inch wide in several areas. I don't know how anybody could look at the house and not see that, and not make that part of their calculation in making an offer. To me an inspection contingency is for things the average buyer does not see -- leaking faucets, electrical, plumbing, etc.  2. We discussed the flooring issue with our realtor *very* thoroughly before listing, because we knew it was an issue. We went through comps and thought we could list for $469,000 and give a credit for floors, or we could list for $459,000 as the straight up price.  I ended up listing for $459,000, and my thought was that this was a fair price given the flooring issue.  This all feels like a last minute shakedown to me to get $5,000 off at the last minute.   The awful thing is that I don't think we can afford to have these buyers back out of the deal. Listing a house with a 3YO and 1YO is awful, and $5,000 is basically two months of operating expenses for the house ($1,500 mortgage, taxes, insurance, etc.). So, it would be a huge gamble to walk over this.  My main question is this -- is something like this negotiable? If I come back and say """"we will do a $2", but $5

6,"""Last year, I sort of FOMO'd into buying my dream car (Honda S2000) which I purchased for $40k cash. At the time, that was the majority of my cash in savings and while I cringed at the thought of rebuilding my emergency funds over the next 6-12 months, the pain was overshadowed by how happy and proud of myself that I was able to save up & finally own it.  Fast-forward to today, the car currently sits at my parent's garage where it only occasionally gets driven on nice weather days (last year, I only drove it 2k miles). I don't own a house at the moment and instead live in a 1 bedroom apartment with my s/o. For daily driving, I drive an old Camry with 150k+ miles on it 2 to 3 times a week as I have a hybrid WFH schedule.  My inner dilemma is: While the car still makes me happy whenever I do get the chance to drive it, the frugal part of me sometimes wishes I had bought a bit cheaper, less nice of an example so that I wouldn't feel so irresponsible/guity about having such a large amount tied up in what is essentially a 100% luxury purchase. Sometimes I end up laying in bed thinking about how I """"should"""" have bought a house first before a nice car / could have saved that money for said down payment on a house (even though I have no intentions/thoughts of purchasing a home yet)", which if I'm being honest makes me have second thoughts about my ownership of the car even though I still love it.  I guess my question is: Should I take comfort in my current financial situation (details below) and just enjoy having my impractical dream car for a while

9,"""Please forgive the lengthy context here but I think it could help.   Situation: late 30's, married, two kids (3 y/o and <1 yr), VHCOL area of California. I have a white-collar job earning $175k and wife is the director of an emergency room earning about $350k on a 1099. Net worth is about $5M, but most is illiquid (house equity, retirement accounts, private equity). Despite the decent income, our budget is tight: taxes are $127k, housing $110k, and savings $136k leaves $80k for childcare and $75k for everything else.   I was feeling burned out after our first child but it's gotten much worse this year with the second. My MIL generously offered to give us 6 months of free live-in childcare after second was born, but three weeks in got seriously ill, and ended up consuming lots of my wife's time to provide and arrange care, and caught us without any childcare. We have no family or friends in town who can help with the kids. We luckily got the older kid into a daycare quickly ($2200/mo) and now have two nannies ($22/hr, one close to full-time, one part-time) but it still doesn't feel like enough. Today, nanny called in sick, because our kid brought home a cold from daycare and gave it to everyone else and the nanny. Second nanny was unavailable, so my wife had to do her day's meetings with a fussing baby, and I had to leave work 5 hours early, which was a big stress and meant I didn't get some things done. This type of thing happens regularly.   Childcare is only part of the problem. The workload from the kids ripples through all areas of life. Just one example: the kitchen. When childless I never minded doing dishes. Even a full cleaning after a big meal only took ~15 minutes with my wife's help, and it felt rewarding to get it done. Now, every meal there is a giant mess with food all over the table, high chairs, and the floor. The house rule is that all non-metal/ceramic dishes must be hand-scrubbed (rather than go into the dishwasher), and this includes two sets of kids' placemats, plates, utensils, sippy cups, and bibs, after every meal (plus the kids themselves). It's about a 30 minute cleanup, 3 times a day, every day. Typically, we do not keep our nanny here through dinner, so usually after dinner my wife and I each put one kid to bed and clean the kitchen afterward. Some nights I have been brought to tears, walking into the kitchen at 9:30pm after fighting to get our older one to bed and seeing a huge mess waiting for me. There have been similar impacts to other areas of life too.   My wife also works lots of nights and weekends. Last weekend she worked all day both days. We had a nanny both days for part of the day, but she can't watch both kids when she's putting the younger down for a nap, so I only got about one hour off each day. Nights with the younger one are stressful, as he wakes up frequently looking for mom, doesn't like the bottles I offer, etc. Then I have to go to work and try to concentrate the next day. Real days """"off"""" are extremely rare", my job has been lower-intensity the last couple years
10,"""What is the method you rely on to keep your retirement income below IRMAA, NIIT, AMT and any other additional taxation that you perhaps did not need to worry about before retirement age?   Retirement often triggers RMDs from Traditional IRAs that you cannot totally avoid through e.g. Roth Conversions. There may also be other investments that mature or must be sold that potentially can push up income for a year or two. So, what is your main means of controlling your income so that you do not end up paying more in tax on your tax deferred retirement savings than you would have paid if you had not deferred it?  Do you just invest in stocks that do not produce dividend income? Do you invest in real estate, although that has property taxes?  Or do you just resign yourself to paying e.g. IRMAA, a """"tax"""" that did not exist when 401ks/Trad IRAs were first pushed as the only way to save for retirement  Those retiring now"," etc. kicks in."""

I'm no longer living in the studio and currently living at my mothers. i don't really want to live at my mothers and thinking it might be better to be back in the van but i can't go back into the vintage van, it has to be the new Ford Transit van but after the recent drop in the market I've been really stressed out.  i don't know what the right thing to do is. i know i have to sell the vintage van and get 30k back. but it is vintage and it will take months to sell.   Due to the drop in the market I can't tell if it is irresponsible to keep the Tesla in addition to the new Ford Transit van. i don't want to own 120+k in vehicles.

35,"""I know the normal work hour is 40 hours a week but not everyone do 40 hours. Some people work more hours, some people work fewer hours. Hours are important because excessive work hours can put a lot of stress and pressure on you. It would be worse if you hate what you are doing along with the hours. How many hours do you work? How many hours do you actually want to work?  I'm a 29 years old millennial. I graduated without any student loan or credit card debt. I used to work 40 hours before April 2021. After getting my MBA last year, I got a new job making six figure. The best part about my job is that I only work from 14 to 17 hours a week. I work in the office three days a week and telework two days a week. Here is how my office work day goes: I usually leave my house around 8:40 am and get to work around 9:10 am. I work in a separate office from my colleagues. They are super chill and the office work culture is super relaxed so nobody ever says anything when I'm late. Sometimes I would be late for like an hour but nothing ever happens to me. I take my lunch break promptly at 11 am. I always take a 2 hour lunch break. During these two hours I watch YouTube videos, eat out at restaurant, and even take a nap. Then I get back to the office around 1 pm or 1:15 pm. Similar to the morning, I can get back a little bit later if I wanted because nobody says anything. I go home around 3 pm at the latest. Many times I go home around 2 pm or 2:30 pm. I usually get home before 3:30 pm. For the rest of the day I have a lot of free time to do whatever I want. I usually play video games, watch YouTube videos, and walk my dog.  Then there is telework. I telework two days a week. But let me be honest: I don't do much work at all during my teleworking days. I usually just log in to check email every two hours or so. I work probably less than 30 minutes on most of my """"teleworking"""" days. Working an hour is like a lot for me when I telework. The thing is", three days a week. I usually work about an hour when I telework

37,"""We have a cruise booked for the end of this year on one of the cruise lines owned by Carnival. The family has been looking forward to it for a long time. We've made a deposit that we can get back if we cancel by September, but after that it has to be paid in full. However, since it's over 21 days since we first booked the cruise, it's apparently too late to buy travel insurance to cover Carnival bankruptcy.  Carnival stock has dropped from around $50/share to around $9/share. They've taken on a ton of debt (over $30B) that I doubt they'll be able to recover from, particularly with skyrocketing fuel costs and a weakening economy. Last quarter they lost $1.8B. They have about $7.5B cash on hand. Recently Morgan Stanley suggested the stock could go to $0 (some might ask why it isn't at zero already).  At the rate they're burning cash, if the economy becomes worse I think it's possible they would have to file this winter, but we'd probably make it under the wire. Plus I doubt it would be chapter 7. More likely a reorganization under chapter 11 (think airlines of past years). The business might continue to operate.   The family (and I) would really like to take this cruise. Strong emotions vs. obvious risk. A recent quote from their CFO really bothers me: """"And remember"," assuming it'll probably be ok? Or bail and do something else you don't like quite as well?

38,"""My mother passed away earlier this year and as a result, my sister and I (both mid 30's) both received inherited IRAs in the $700k range.  My sister decided to buy a house in cash (~500k) by borrowing from the inherited IRA with the intent of returning the funds back to the IRA within the 60 day window based on her financial advisor's advice.  My sister sold her previous house and we also received proceeds from selling my mother's condo within a couple weeks of her buying the new house.  These funds had been expected to replenish the inherited IRA within the 60 day window.  As it turns out, the financial advisor was wrong and Inherited IRAs do not allow for the 60 day repayment window.  Any advice/strategy I should pass on given her situation?  She will be going from ~60k/year in income to 560k which will hit her pretty hard tax bracket-wise.  Isn't a financial advisor supposed to shield the uninformed from these types of issues?  FYI, this advisor works for one of the large firms frequently mentioned here.    Thanks in advance.   ** UPDATE ** I sat in on the meeting with the financial advisor today.  He spent a couple minutes saying he's done this before and that the IRS no longer allows it.  He then quickly jumped to the """"Good News"""" which was that the money to be returned could be invested in Option A (Conservative)"," the """"not a tax expert"""" line came out.

There are separate departments that don't take phone calls, and stuff just is sent into a queue - so if you have an actual problem, like with a wire or something else - you're out of luck.  I had a few hundred thousand I was trying to use in high yield savings - so I had opened an account with them.  Fortunately I only moved 100k because then they told me, you can only move 10k a day in or out of the account.  I had decided I wanted to move more than 10k, which s only 10% of the funds I had and they wouldn't let me.  So then I figured, fine - if they are going to lock up my 100k, I will just wire it out.  NOPE.  I call in, wait an hour on hold, they say they can't do anything - I'm waiting 48 hrs for a wire transfer of my money now.  So if you want to move more than 10k for the first 90 days, you simply can't.  Btw, I asked them about this before I moved in the money and they misinformed me the transfer minimums were lower.  Even Marcus can move 125k a day.    Then I call back, wait on hold for 25 min because someone doesn't know what to do, then she hangs up on me.

We currently own a perfectly fine, 4 bedroom 2900 sq ft home in a nice neighborhood; purchased 3.5 years ago and refinanced to a 2.625% mortgage (thanks LenderFi!) with about $340,000 remaining on the mortgage.  However, we bought the home during a corporate relocation, and in doing so we compromised on several things we really wanted in order to get other must-haves and to not be in limbo or a rental with all of our stuff.  Notably, we sacrificed some square footage, three-car garage, and useable storage.    Earlier this year, we started talking to one of the new construction builders in our neighborhood about building new.  We connected with a quasi-iBuyer (Orchard), who we contracted with to buy our home for a set amount prior to closing on a new home (either pre-owned or new construction) and then sells our old home once we've moved out, paying us the difference between the first payment and the last minus their regular real estate commission. At the time, they projected our house to sell for around $570,000-$580,000 and they agreed to pay us $520,000 up front.  The market is somewhat more depressed since then but we're still guaranteed the $520,000 even if the house only sold for that (or less).  For clarity, we're under no obligation to sell to Orchard unless we want to go ahead with this process.  Ultimately, we started to shy away from new construction and put the brakes on any plans.  Fast forward to two weeks ago, a house came on the market in our neighborhood that checks all of our boxes.  We've done several walk throughs and fell in love with the property (got the same instant connection we did when we bought our first house as a newlywed couple years ago).  It's only about 250 square feet bigger than our current house, but has the storage, larger garage, and an incredible view and backyard that we won't (bottom line, it check's all of our """"boxes"""").

How can I avoid this huge penalty?  A few points here: 1. My business has been “Permanently Revoked” in registering state and has had no income since 2017. 2. My solo 401K is only for myself and has about $450K in it, it did not have new contribution since 2017. I closed it and moved the money to my personal rollover IRA account on 4/15/2022. 3. I have filed 5500-ez for 2021 on 04/03/2022 and final 2022 on 5/24/2022  4. I never received any reminder letters either from 401k plan provider or IRS  ------------------------------- Here is what happened for the timeline:  3/28/2022, I received the notification letter from IRS dated 3/18/2022 regarding the “Compliance check Information Request”, notifying me that I have not filed the 5500-EZ for the year 2018, 2019, 2020. 4/3/2022, I filled and signed the 5500-ez forms for 2018, 219, 2020 on paper, but did not mail out.  4/6/2022, I called contact person on the previous letter after a few days of trying. She informed me to: Finish all the necessary materials for the “Penalty Relief Program under Procedure 2015-32”. Mail all the material to the designated address to Ogden, UT also Send a copy of the material to her so that she can input quickly to the system 4/7/2022, I mailed one letter along with the check of $1500 to the designated address in IRS letter. It contains: Form 14704, stating it contains 5500-ez forms for year 2018, 2019, 2022 A check with $1500 for the maximum charge for the plan. One Form 5500-EZ for Tax period December 31, 2018 One Form 5500-EZ for Tax period December 31, 2019 One Form 5500-EZ for Tax period December 31, 2020. 4/18/2022, I checked my bank account, and verified that the $1500 check was cashed by IRS. I thought the issue has been resolved.  However, here is what my stupid move is: On 4/3/2022, after I finished filing for 2021 at https://www.efast.dol.gov/ site, I electronically filed these two forms: 5500-ez for year 2018 using the 2021 form (used beginning 01/01/2018 and ending 12/31/2018) 5500-ez for year 2020 with the 2020 form  5/4/2022, I received the two letters of CP283 dated 5/2/2022 for Penalty charge of Form 5500 for Tax period ending: December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2020.  ------------------------------------ These are the actions I took after I got the penalty letters 1.	On 5/6/2022, I talked to IRS agent with penalty letter phone number, she asked me to allow IRS more time (30 days) 2.	On 5/9/2022, I called the TaxPayer Advocate office asking for help, and faxed the form 911 and other materials to the office. 3.	I received a letter from TaxPayer Advocate office dated 5/10/2022, asking to allow IRS more time based on their account research. 4.	I was calling the contact person on compliance letter daily, trying to see whether she got my letter.  5.	On 5/12/2022, the contact person called me back. She said that she has not received my letter, so I faxed her the copy of my original mail sent on 4/7/2022. I am calling her daily again (leaving voice mail every day) to see whether she got my fax, but she never answered or returned my call. 6.	On 5/25/2022, I talked to another agent with the phone number on penalty letter, he told me to write a letter for penalty removal with reasonable cause, and faxed it along with other materials. He told me that he did see the $1500 check, but he did not see the letters and 3 5500-ez forms that I mailed in on April 7th. He said it may take up to 90 days to process. But he think I should file for reasonable cause.  ------------------------------------ I searched online, and found that the reasonable cause for penalty removal has very high bar, Fire, casualty, natural disaster or other disturbances Inability to obtain records Death, serious illness, incapacitation or unavoidable absence of the taxpayer or a member of the taxpayer’s immediate family Other reason which establishes that you used all ordinary business care and prudence to meet your Federal tax obligations but were nevertheless unable to do so  Question: 1. Is the reasonable cause letter my only option to resolve this issue? 2. Anyone had experience resolving the CP283 based on reasonable cause letter? what are the other possible reasons other than those disasters? 3.

Help me figure this out and see if it is possible to go from 2 to 1 incomes (or if not, potentially part time)  Long story short, through some good luck and side business, we might have about 500k cash after taxes.  We have a new born and if wife can stay at home, we would like her to, just as long as it doesnt hurt us in the long run too much.    Im mid 30s, shes a few years younger. I make about 60, she makes about 80.  Rental grosses 12k a year. We spend between 4.5-5 on average a month between fixed/non fixed Retirement funds sit around 150k.  We invest about 30k a year into retirement accounts (15k of it from her) 25ish years left on personal home (130k left at 3.5%), 25ish years left on rental (60k at 3.85), no other debt Currently grandparents watching new born so no child cost.  How would you use that 500k to allow her to enjoy these years, but also allow this money to set us up for the long run?  With the amount I bring home, and rental income, we wouldnt have enough for our monthly expenses (we wouldnt like to change too much), so would need to use some of that cash to live.  If I use 200k (round numbers) to pay off both properties, that will put us at basically break even every month for income and expenditures. (paying off both will save us about 1k a month).

96,"""We are in the process of preparing an updated estate plan and have engaged the Trust & Estate group in a decent-sized firm (offices in 7 cities).  We could use some advice on their proposal.  Our situation:  Married, retired, no children, 7 figure estate, not in a community property state. No ex-spouses.  No family close by.  ~85% will go to charity on second death; remainder to 2 nieces (both are married).  We have assets in a residence, joint taxable brokerage account, tIRAs and Roth IRAs.  We also have a Fidelity DAF.  All securities are publicly traded.  Our plan is to give the nieces pieces of the Roths, which hopefully they will be smart enough to stretch out for 10 years.  The primary concern for us is setting up things as best we can to where a trusted friend can step in to manage our affairs if we become incapable of doing so; with a minimum of hassle for the friend.  While we could set this up using durable powers of attorney (DPOAs), we are concerned about the many stories of financial institutions refusing to honor attorney-prepared DPOAs.  While we can (and will) fill out Fidelity’s own DPOA, it doesn’t allow for successor agents.  Note that we are less concerned about disposition of our assets after our deaths than we are about making it easier to manage our affairs while we are alive.  The attorney has suggested a revocable living trust for each of us, splitting our joint taxable assets between the trusts.  Each trust would become irrevocable upon death.  The law firm first suggested making the irrevocable trusts the contingent beneficiary of the retirement accounts, which would then be distributed by the trustee to the nieces (over 10 years) and charities.    This seemed like a lot of complexity to me, especially the disposition of the retirement accounts.  The way I'm currently handling it is that the nieces are each TOD beneficiaries of a percentage of one of the Roths that works out to about 7% of total assets each.  Every so often I update those percentages (very easy at Fidelity) to reflect changes in market value.  I'm not particularly concerned that they get exactly 7%, so it's okay if that value floats around between """"adjustments"""".
