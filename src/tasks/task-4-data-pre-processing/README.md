## task-4-data-pre-processing

Using the EDA from task-3, we selected the most relevant questions-answers from each data sources. All the CSv files has been restructured in a two columns (Questions-Answers) format. Finally all the CSV files has been merged in one file and then will be used by task-5-model-selection-and-deployement. We also decided to have two outcomes. One with no pre-processing and the other with the pre-processsing template present in this directory.

### Data are available in the Data directory.
