been budgeting with my partner for about years married for together for we are both pretty conservative with our money and align similarly we reevaluate our budget biyearly together and typically agree on budgeting decisions we do prioritize different things which can cause some conflict which i am sure is common we set aside money for \\u201cfun money\\u201d each month and that includes all of our personal expenses drink with friends any shopping that is above our clothing budget any other expenses that are \\u201cnonessential\\u201d i guess i am wondering what everyone considers \\u201cnonessential\\u201d for example i wear makeup and use more skin hair products than my husband what do i consider essential and nonessential if i run out of foundation and need to purchase another one i consider that essential but if i just want a new lip product because i think i would enjoy it i use my fun money that makes sense to me but what about skin hair care products within reason that i consider essential but i am partner feels is extra spending should come out of \\u201cfun money\\u201d he doesn\\u2019t really run into this issue because he has a pretty basic routine

such but i do not know what my needs are for the change i am not necessarily wanting to invest or just save but i also do not wanna pay for features i do not need such as acorns debit account with

those who help themselves so i guess the advice i am looking for is from people who actually got thru to their parents and if this is not the best sub for this have a better one to share please do\\r\\n\\r\\ntldr my mom does not understand money or how creditloans work being current means she is paid the past due amount while still leaving a balance any attempt to help her budget is met with i do not need your help i am not a child how do you help people like this \\r\\n\\r\\nmy mom is approaching parents divorced many many many years agobasically i have never known married parents she works an insane amount in a job that is not kind to the body but yet is always behind on bills for as long as she is done this job she does not qualify for supervisory roles because of her attitude it is pretty entitled tbh one of those i am not wrong i just do not like their rules types nothing is ever her fault etc i can say that she does pay me back after a couple months when she borrows money my biggest concern if she does not get her finances in order is that she will basically work herself to death anytime i ask about her retirement plan i am met with that is none of your business um it is my business if you are going to have to live with me barbara i need to plan for that because at present i am not \\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i do help her with money i always tell her that we need to sit down and figure out her budget i know she can live a comfy life based off the area she lives in her salary as it is comparable to mine and i have zero struggles not because they do not exist but because i realized early i was starting to use her same bad habits ie insane credit card use her response each time is no we are not doing that i am not a toddler well no shit but here we are again you asking me for thousands of dollars because you do not seem to understand that past due and current due are separate things i just got finished sending her to get her car note current she kept saying her balance was she was not sure why she owed any money turns out the past due balance was but she still owed balloon payments because she pushed payments to the end of her loan plus some fees it is a very predatory loan honestly but looking more into it it seems like it is her own doing for the position her loan is in but you cant tell her that because it is not her faultit is never her fault and it is annoying\\r\\n\\r\\nis there any help for a person like this do any of you have the same parents were able to actually get thru to them\",\n\"2022-11-16 02:15:16\",\n\"advice help

allows you to save the net amount you should have at the end of the month there are some groupings as well for say a mortgage or rent to include the other components of each if you pay for internet

away\\r\\n\\r\\nthe big three\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen talking about saving money there are thousands of little things that can save you a buck or two but you may be better served by looking for the bigger wins\\r\\n\\r\\nmy first tips come from what i am going to refer to as the \\u201cbig three\\u201d housing transportation and food on average these three categories tend to take up a good portion a monthly cashflow\\r\\n\\r\\nroommates nothing says \\u201ci am an adult\\u201d more than having your own place well except maybe being able to pay your bills especially in locations where rents are high adding a roommate to your household can be a huge win for all my fellow introverts out there i know it can feel like a big sacrifice but adopt a roommate you really love or one who has a different schedule than your own you might find you have the place to yourself more than you anticipated i know this is a change that might be hard to make today or even within the next few months but keep it in the back of your mind as your lease comes up for renewal savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\ntransportation even as we see a bit of a break in the gas price surge it\\u2019s always a good idea to evaluate your transportation practices if there is little flexibility in your options to get to work like carpooling or biking there is still probably some dollars to be saved on nights and weekends get thoughtful with your errands so you can knock them out in one trip rather than a nightly ride in the gas guzzler for my city folk skip the cab and learn a new bus route savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\ngrocery store for those who don\\u2019t know this is the place where you buy food to bring into your home and then you can eat it whenever you want most of the time it\\u2019s cheaper too get that store savings card make a list and look for products you enjoy that happen to be on sale this week even if like me you\\u2019re a creature of habit don\\u2019t be afraid to choose a new brand of peanut butter if it\\u2019s going to save you a few bucks savings mo\\r\\n\\r\\nok i know the grocery store might not be as exciting as checking out all the newest culinary delights so let\\u2019s get into some money savers when dining out \\u200d\\u200d where are you eating there can be a big monetary difference between full service restaurants and places where you order at the counter do not save extra money by being a bad tipper if you are choosing to eat at a restaurant with a waitstaff calculate that extra or more in your brain before you enter the door if it\\u2019s going to be too much of a stretch to tip be kind to our friends in the service industry and come back when it\\u2019s more doable savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\nrestaurant extras you can have a great experience get a good meal and be a generous tipper without having to break the bank restaurants love to catch you with the extras opt for water over alcohol or soda share an appetizer and maybe skip the meat tonight you\\u2019d be surprised how much you can reduce the bill by choosing just one of these alternatives or do all three savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\nfrequency if you are eating at restaurants every night you might find the novelty wearing off quick and your paycheck disappearing even quicker try to space out your trips to restaurants and maybe replace them with date nights cooking at home if you are wondering where the food will come from see above grocery store savings mo\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u200dok let\\u2019s wrap this up with a couple of miscellaneous items outside of the big three \\u200d subscriptions if you are scrolling your subscription menus more than watching the content it may be time to eliminate a service or two if you want to go one step further pull out those credit card statements and see if you have forgotten to cancel any subscriptions you no longer use savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\nclothing before you plan another shopping trip take a deep dive into your closet and take stock of what you own and the frequency in which you wear your items remove things you doubt you will wear again and get yourself to a second hand store trigger warning selling your clothes at certain second hand stores can cause you to question all of your life choices if they decide your items are worthy of purchase they usually offer you cash or store credit take a look around and your unworn pieces might turn into your new favorite vintage shirt savings mo\\u200d\\r\\n\\r\\ncell phone \\u201chello can you hear me\\u201d there is a lot of money to be saved here with just a bit of research and no change in habit i was able to reduce my monthly cell phone plan from to check out your previous data usage and question the need for the unlimited plan wifi is everywhere ask if your provider has a cheaper prepaid plan all you\\u2019re really doing is paying on a different date and try to take advantage of any loyalty programs if you\\u2019ve exhausted all efforts threaten to leave it\\u2019s funny how often a new offer will suddenly \\u201cpop up\\u201d in these instances also just because we have been placed into a system with a standard year payment

chance that with an hourly car you can lose more than you put in if you return the car late its a fee plus you have to refill all the gas that you use and if you do not they will charge you even more than the cost of the gas usually i would make somewhere between an hour so a hour day i could make around especially on the weekend an average hour day would be around i am wondering if i should just use my money towards that i just have bad anxiety and feel like something would go wrong plus i have to factor in the cost of the bus so that would be around or i could buy a bike and deliver by bike

months and i even got a credit line increase out of nowhere but i will be using it again in about weeks because i have no choice last paycheck i went to get a check up on my car and come to find out that what was supposed to be a trip is a trip and i could not afford it then so i only paid for a third and now i have to go back and pay the rest to get my car fixed all the way as i can feel how bad my car is and i pay rent next month and my rent just went up and my paycheck is not going to be able to cover both nowhere near \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich means i will have to play catch up every single paycheck after that i am not even celebrating any holidays this year bc i cannot afford it i have only eaten out twice this month and each time was less than purchase i am eating pbj is for lunch everyday with one slice of bread so i can stretch out the loaf as much as i can i only have a spotify subscription i pay my cc bill every month but i still can ever afford the minimum which i know is just really not even paying off the card\\r\\n\\r\\ni have been poorin poverty my whole life and i thought getting away from my family and going to college would get me away from that i picked a horrible degree for money but in my defense growing up where i did they do not teach you about degrees and what gets you money they just teach you to get out of here and go to college before you get stuck although that is no excuse i am to blame i just feel like no matter how hard i try nothing changes i am still just a poor girl who is just acting like she is got it handled and i do not know what to do \\r\\n\\r\\ni am sorry for complaining any advice or tips in playing the catch up game with my paychecks i think would be nice i i think i just needed to rent because i do not have anyone

my first job after college i want to budget for it appropriately as i understand the importance of doing so i have not actually started yet so i do not know what my actual monthly income will be this is just my best estimate same goes for most of my expenses theyre only estimates and likely will end up being lower than the actual values i have for them lastly i am very aware that my estimate for gas and groceries are very high but i will end up having a long commute to work about hour one direction and to the city minutes one direction as well as just moving in to a new place starting fresh i feel like my groceries will at first be quite high as i settle in i would rather overestimate than underestimate so without further adieu here is my monthly budget\\r\\n\\r\\nmonthly income

will outpace the interest rates on them and instead use my credit card maximum as my emergency fund and invest into real estate i want to hear second opinions though and if you guys think i should do

everyone\\r\\n\\r\\ni have a very particular budget sheet question that is probably me just over thinking things but here i am \\r\\n\\r\\ni made my own spreadsheet and it really works for me but i am not sure how to exactly write outkeep track of my travel expenses which is where most of my fun money is spent i set aside money every month to save for travel i do quite a bit of it and have a running total saved which is good but i also like to keep track of how much i actually spend every single month including on travel and so want to fill out my main spreadsheet with every single purchase that includes flight tickets purchased on a given month and the hotel charges when you actually travel a month later or what have you \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat happens then is i am not quite sure what my travel save category is doing on my spreadsheet since i have already paid for and tracked all my travel expenses as i go for example had a trip to the uk a month ago i bought the ticket back in march that was counted as a travel expense in march picked up a new bag for it in april so a travel expense in april then in may june were the actual hotel charges food expenses etc when i was there i just tracked it all every day like i normally do and ended up with like only leftover after expenses for the month of june even though i technically had x amount of money saved since january for the trip and that i had put in a separate account and that shows up as part of my net income on my spreadsheet ie say you have total net since january and you designated of that as toward travel \\r\\n\\r\\nanyway so i guess my question is how else can i be categorizing this on my spreadsheet importantly i want to know how much money i am actually spending on travel as a category which is why i count it on my spreadsheet with my regular monthly expenses i like to calculate what percentage of my income i am spending on different categories travel in general going out to eat drinks with friends etc including bills and other less fun categories i also recognize though that i have x amount saved for this purpose that is not necessarily showing up this way so next time i go somewhere it might show me as for the month but i am not technically bc i had a surplus of savings or what have you again maybe my brain just cannot handle that it might show as negative one month but it is the overall total that matters \\r\\n\\r\\nanyway looking for any tips suggestions etc and learning more about how you all actually write out travel expenses or other big purchasesfun purchases on your budgets\",\n\"2022-07-16 12:21:37\",\n\"categorize travelother big purchase budget spreadsheet\",\n\"hi \\r\\n\\r\\n particular budget sheet question probably think thing \\r\\n\\r\\n spreadsheet work

that i need to make changes to what is being withheld on top of that i will be paying taxes as a single person rather than married and the current budget i have does not take that in account and it seems like in order to break even i have to take out over a paycheck just to not have to pay an extreme amount of taxes come next year of course that puts me in a huge bind and i am freaking out and i

perspectives on this especially if you budget the same way that i do i am not sure if i am being realistic with my expectations here re how far my new income will take me if i should consider rearranging amounts any what you would recommend and what you have done in your experience etc\\r\\n\\r\\nmy budgeting method i used to use an excel spreadsheet that i set up for myself just to do basic tracking and goal measuring then i moved to loosely tracking and rearranging my budget on my phone just using a note app finally i stopped tracking beyond checking my bank accounts every other day and practicing mindfulness and minimalism in other words i consider my purchases more carefully and when i see my checking account go down below a certain range i really tighten up on spending until my next paycheck i also use my credit card to pay for a lot of things and i completely pay off whatever is on it every few days this helps give me back some money every month with rewards it has been working for me for several months now and is a lot less stressful for me i am also that make more money kind of gal vs maximize your current budget and so i am also planning on making even more money in the next years depending on promotions etc the way i spend money is all bills are on autopay and i have reminders for myself on the of every month to get those taken care of right away i have a humble amount of that is set to automatically move from checking to savings for an emergency fund every time my paycheck hits the bank i have an hsa and through work that is deducted and distributed before my paycheck hits my bank again everything else i put on my credit card and i pay it off every few days every once in a while i will go through month by month and think on what subscriptions and services i do not use and what i can cancel\\r\\n\\r\\nthe distribution i just got a new job hurray and i am very happy because i think it is a total increase to my income hard to calculate because i am moving from hourly to salary plus benefits will cost a bit more taxes and benefits considered i think i will be getting month more pay check i will not actually have a solid feel for my new income amount until those paychecks start hitting the bank but i thought it would be best to give these extra is a specific purpose and set it up on autopaymentsmovements to maximize them instead of just throwing them into the mix and tempting myself to spend more the planned spread right now is\\r\\n\\r\\n month for student loans and i anticipate that as i make more money in future positions i will add more to this amount i am currently not paying my student loans down yet\\r\\n month for a futureoriented savings fund house downpayment etc\\r\\n month for emergency savings this would be in
